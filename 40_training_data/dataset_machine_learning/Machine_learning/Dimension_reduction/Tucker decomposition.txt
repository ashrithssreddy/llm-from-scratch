In mathematics, Tucker decomposition decomposes a tensor into a set of matrices and one small core tensor.  It is named after Ledyard R. Tucker

although it goes back to Hitchcock in 1927.

Initially described as a three-mode extension of factor analysis and principal component analysis it may actually be generalized to higher mode analysis, which is also called higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) or the  M-mode SVD.  The algorithm to which the literature typically refers when discussing the Tucker decomposition or the HOSVD is the  M-mode SVD algorithm introduced by Vasilescu and Terzopoulos, but misattributed to Tucker or De Lathauwer etal.

It may be regarded as a more flexible PARAFAC (parallel factor analysis) model.  In PARAFAC the core tensor is restricted to be "diagonal".

In practice, Tucker decomposition is used as a modelling tool. For instance, it is used to model three-way (or higher way) data by means of relatively small numbers of components for each of the three or more modes, and the components are linked to each other by a three- (or higher-) way core array. The model parameters are estimated in such a way that, given fixed numbers of components, the modelled data optimally resemble the actual data in the least squares sense. The model gives a summary of the information in the data, in the same way as principal components analysis does for two-way data.

For a 3rd-order tensor  T \in F^{n_{1} \times n_{2} \times n_{3}}, where F is either \mathbb{R} or \mathbb{C}, Tucker Decomposition can be denoted as follows,

T = \mathcal{T} \times_{1} U^{(1)} \times_{2} U^{(2)} \times_{3} U^{(3)}

where  \mathcal{T} \in F^{d_{1} \times d_{2} \times d_{3}} is the core tensor, a 3rd-order tensor that contains the 1-mode, 2-mode and 3-mode singular values of T, which are defined as the Frobenius norm of the 1-mode, 2-mode and 3-mode slices of tensor \mathcal{T} respectively.  U^{(1)}, U^{(2)}, U^{(3)} are unitary matrices in  F^{d_{1} \times n_{1}}, F^{d_{2} \times n_{2}}, F^{d_{3} \times n_{3}}  respectively. The k-mode product (k = 1, 2, 3) of   \mathcal{T}  by  U^{(k)}  is denoted as   \mathcal{T} \times U^{(k)} with entries as

\begin{align}

(\mathcal{T} \times_{1} U^{(1)})(i_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}) &= \sum_{j_{1}=1}^{d_{1}} \mathcal{T}(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3})U^{(1)}(j_{1}, i_{1}) \\

(\mathcal{T} \times_{2} U^{(2)})(j_{1}, i_{2}, j_{3}) &= \sum_{j_{2}=1}^{d_{2}} \mathcal{T}(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3})U^{(2)}(j_{2}, i_{2}) \\

(\mathcal{T} \times_{3} U^{(3)})(j_{1}, j_{2}, i_{3}) &= \sum_{j_{3}=1}^{d_{3}} \mathcal{T}(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3})U^{(3)}(j_{3}, i_{3})

\end{align}

Altogether, the decomposition may also be written more directly as

T(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3})

=

\sum_{j_{1}=1}^{d_{1}}

\sum_{j_{2}=1}^{d_{2}}

\sum_{j_{3}=1}^{d_{3}}

\mathcal{T}(j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3})

U^{(1)}(j_{1}, i_{1})

U^{(2)}(j_{2}, i_{2})

U^{(3)}(j_{3}, i_{3})

Taking d_i = n_i for all i is always sufficient to represent T exactly, but often T can be compressed or efficiently approximately by choosing d_i . A common choice is d_1 = d_2 = d_3 = \min(n_1, n_2, n_3), which can be effective when the difference in dimension sizes is large.

There are two special cases of Tucker decomposition:

Tucker1: if U^{(2)} and U^{(3)} are identity, then T = \mathcal{T} \times_{1} U^{(1)}

Tucker2: if U^{(3)} is identity, then T = \mathcal{T} \times_{1} U^{(1)} \times_{2} U^{(2)} .

RESCAL decomposition  can be seen as a special case of Tucker where U^{(3)} is identity and U^{(1)} is equal to U^{(2)} .
