Multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA)  is a multilinear extension of principal component analysis (PCA) that is used to analyze M-way arrays, also informally referred to as "data tensors". M-way arrays may be modeled by

linear tensor models, such as CANDECOMP/Parafac, or by

multilinear tensor models, such as multilinear  principal component analysis (MPCA) terminology as a way to better differentiate between multilinear data models that employed 2nd order statistics or whose observations are treated as a collection of column/row observations, an "observation as a matrix", and concatenated into a data tensor.  The latter approach is suitable for compression and reducing redundancy in the rows, columns and fibers that are unrelated to the causal factors of data formation.

Vasilescu and Terzopoulos in their paper "TensorFaces"

or the Tucker which employ the power method or gradient descent, respectively.

Vasilescu and Terzopoulos framed the data analysis, recognition and synthesis problems as multilinear tensor problems. Data is viewed as the compositional consequence of several causal factors, that are well suited for multi-modal tensor factor analysis.  The power of the tensor framework was showcased by analyzing human motion joint angles, facial images or textures in the following papers: Human Motion Signatures

(CVPR 2001, ICPR 2002), face recognition – TensorFaces, while a semi-supervised MPCA feature selection is employed in visualization tasks.

Extensions

Various extension of MPCA:

Robust MPCA (RMPCA)

Multi-Tensor Factorization, that also finds the number of components automatically (MTF)
