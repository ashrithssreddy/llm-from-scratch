Within statistical factor analysis, the factor regression model, or hybrid factor model, is a special multivariate model with the following form:

\mathbf{y}_n= \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_n+   \mathbf{B}\mathbf{z}_n +\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n

where,

\mathbf{y}_n  is the n-th  G \times 1  (known) observation.

\mathbf{x}_n  is the n-th sample  L_x  (unknown) hidden factors.

\mathbf{A}  is the (unknown) loading matrix of the  hidden factors.

\mathbf{z}_n  is the n-th sample  L_z  (known) design factors.

\mathbf{B}  is the (unknown) regression coefficients of the design factors.

\mathbf{c}  is a vector of (unknown) constant term or intercept.

\mathbf{e}_n  is a vector of (unknown) errors, often white Gaussian noise.

Relationship between factor regression model, factor model and regression model

The factor regression model can be viewed as a combination of factor analysis model ( \mathbf{y}_n= \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_n+   \mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n ) and regression model ( \mathbf{y}_n=   \mathbf{B}\mathbf{z}_n +\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n ).

Alternatively, the model can be viewed as a special kind of factor model, the hybrid factor model

\begin{align}

& \mathbf{y}_n = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_n+   \mathbf{B}\mathbf{z}_n +\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n \\

= & \begin{bmatrix}

\mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B}

\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}

\mathbf{x}_n \\

\mathbf{z}_n\end{bmatrix} +\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n \\

= & \mathbf{D}\mathbf{f}_n +\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{e}_n

\end{align}

where,  \mathbf{D}=\begin{bmatrix}

\mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B}

\end{bmatrix}  is the loading matrix of the hybrid factor model and  \mathbf{f}_n=\begin{bmatrix}

\mathbf{x}_n \\

\mathbf{z}_n\end{bmatrix}  are the factors, including the known factors and unknown factors.
