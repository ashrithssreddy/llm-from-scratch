The questionable cause—also known as causal fallacy, false cause, or non causa pro causa ("non-cause for cause" in Latin)—is a category of informal fallacies in which the cause or causes is/are incorrectly identified. In other words, it is a fallacy of reaching a conclusion that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated.

Questionable cause can be logically reduced to: "A is regularly associated with B; therefore, A causes B."

For example: "Every time I score an A on the test its a sunny day. Therefore the sunny day causes me to score well on the test." Here is the example the two events may coincide or correlate, but have no causal connection.

Fallacies of questionable cause include:

Circular cause and consequence

Correlation implies causation (cum hoc, ergo propter hoc)

Third-cause fallacy

Wrong direction

Fallacy of the single cause

Post hoc ergo propter hoc

Observational interpretation fallacy

Regression fallacy

Texas sharpshooter fallacy

Jumping to conclusions

Association fallacy

Magical thinking
