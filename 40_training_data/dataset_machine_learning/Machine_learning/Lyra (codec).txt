Lyra is a lossy audio codec developed by Google that is designed for compressing speech at very low bitrates. Unlike most other audio formats, it compresses data using a machine learning-based algorithm.

Features

The Lyra codec is designed to transmit speech in real-time when bandwidth is severely restricted, such as over slow or unreliable network connections. It runs at fixed bitrates of 3.2, 6, and 9&nbsp;kbit/s and it is intended to provide better quality than codecs that use traditional waveform-based algorithms at similar bitrates. Lyra imposes 20&nbsp;ms of latency due to its frame size. Ian Buckley at MakeUseOf said, "It succeeds in creating almost eerie levels of audio reproduction with bitrates as low as 3&nbsp;kbps." Google claims that it reproduces natural-sounding speech, and that Lyra at 3&nbsp;kbit/s beats Opus at 8&nbsp;kbit/s.

Lyra was first announced in February 2021,

Support

Implementations

Google's implementation is available on GitHub under the Apache License. Written in C++, it is optimized for 64-bit ARM but also runs on x86, on either Android or Linux.

Applications

Google Meet uses Lyra to transmit sound for video chats when bandwidth is limited.
