A Tsetlin machine is an artificial intelligence algorithm based on propositional logic.

Background

A Tsetlin machine is a form of learning automaton collective for learning patterns using propositional logic. Ole-Christoffer Granmo created and gave the method its name after Michael Lvovitch Tsetlin, who invented the Tsetlin automaton and worked on Tsetlin automata collectives and games. Collectives of Tsetlin automata were originally constructed, implemented, and studied theoretically by Vadim Stefanuk in 1962.

The Tsetlin machine uses computationally simpler and more efficient primitives compared to more ordinary artificial neural networks.

As of April 2018 it has shown promising results on a number of test sets.

Hardware

One of the first FPGA-based hardware implementation of the Tsetlin Machine on the Iris flower data set was developed by the μSystems (microSystems) Research Group at Newcastle University.

They also presented the first ASIC implementation of the Tsetlin Machine focusing on energy frugality, claiming it could deliver 10 trillion operation per Joule. The ASIC design had demoed on DATA2020.
