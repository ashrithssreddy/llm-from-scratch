In computer science, a logistic model tree (LMT) is a classification model with an associated supervised training algorithm that combines logistic regression (LR) and decision tree learning.

Logistic model trees are based on the earlier idea of a model tree: a decision tree that has linear regression models at its leaves to provide a piecewise linear regression model (where ordinary decision trees with constants at their leaves would produce a piecewise constant model).

The basic LMT induction algorithm uses cross-validation to find a number of LogitBoost iterations that does not overfit the training data. A faster version has been proposed that uses the Akaike information criterion to control LogitBoost stopping.
