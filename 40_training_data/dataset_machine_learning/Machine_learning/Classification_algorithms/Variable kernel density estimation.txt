In statistics, adaptive or "variable-bandwidth" kernel density estimation is a form of kernel density estimation in which the size of the kernels used in the estimate are varied

depending upon either the location of the samples or the location of the test point.

It is a particularly effective technique when the sample space is multi-dimensional.

Rationale

Given a set of samples, \lbrace \vec x_i \rbrace, we wish to estimate the

density, P(\vec x), at a test point, \vec x:

P(\vec x) \approx \frac{W}{n h^D}

W = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i

w_i = K \left ( \frac{\vec x - \vec x_i}{h} \right )

where n is the number of samples, K is the

"kernel", h is its width and D is the number of dimensions in \vec x.

The kernel can be thought of as a simple, linear filter.

Using a fixed filter width may mean that in regions of low density, all samples

will fall in the tails of the filter with very low weighting, while regions of high

density will find an excessive number of samples in the central region with weighting

close to unity.  To fix this problem, we vary the width of the kernel in different

regions of the sample space.

There are two methods of doing this: balloon and pointwise estimation.

In a balloon estimator, the kernel width is varied depending on the location

of the test point.  In a pointwise estimator, the kernel width is varied depending

on the location of the sample.

There are two components to the error: a variance term and a bias term.  The variance term is given as:

Alternatively, we can divide up the sum based on the class of each sample:

P(j, \vec{x}) \approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1, c_i=j}^n w_i

where ci is the class of the ith sample.

The class of the test point may be estimated through maximum likelihood.
