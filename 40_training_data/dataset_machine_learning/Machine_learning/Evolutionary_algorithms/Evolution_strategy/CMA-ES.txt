Covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is a particular kind of strategy for numerical optimization. Evolution strategies (ES) are stochastic, derivative-free methods for numerical optimization  of non-linear or non-convex continuous optimization problems. They belong to the class of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation.  An evolutionary algorithm is broadly based on the principle of biological evolution, namely the repeated interplay of variation (via recombination and mutation) and selection: in each generation (iteration) new individuals (candidate solutions, denoted as x) are generated by variation of the current parental individuals, usually in a stochastic way. Then, some individuals are selected to become the parents in the next generation based on their fitness or objective function value f(x). Like this, individuals with better and better f-values are generated over the generation sequence.

In an evolution strategy, new candidate solutions are usually sampled according to a multivariate normal distribution in \mathbb{R}^n. Recombination amounts to selecting a new mean value for the distribution. Mutation amounts to adding a random vector, a perturbation with zero mean. Pairwise dependencies between the variables in the distribution are represented by a covariance matrix. The covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) is a method to update the covariance matrix of this distribution. This is particularly useful if the function f is ill-conditioned.

Adaptation of the covariance matrix amounts to learning a second order model of the underlying objective function similar to the approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix in the quasi-Newton method in classical optimization. In contrast to most classical methods, fewer assumptions on the underlying objective function are made. Because only a ranking (or, equivalently, sorting) of candidate solutions is exploited, neither derivatives nor even an (explicit) objective function is required by the method. For example, the ranking could come about from pairwise competitions between the candidate solutions in a Swiss-system tournament.

Principles

Two main principles for the adaptation of parameters of the search distribution are exploited in the CMA-ES algorithm.

First, a maximum-likelihood principle predicated on the idea that increasing (though not necessarily maximizing) the sample probability of successful candidate solutions or search directions is beneficial. The mean of the distribution is updated such that the likelihood of previously successful candidate solutions is maximized. The covariance matrix of the distribution is updated (incrementally) such that the likelihood of previously successful search steps is increased. Both updates can be interpreted as a natural gradient descent. Also, in consequence, the CMA conducts an iterated principal components analysis of successful search steps while retaining all principal axes. Estimation of distribution algorithms and the Cross-Entropy Method are based on very similar ideas, but generally estimate (non-incrementally) the covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood of successful solution points rather than successful search steps.

Second, two paths of the time evolution of the distribution mean of the strategy are recorded, called search or evolution paths. These paths contain significant information about the correlation between consecutive steps. Specifically, if consecutive steps are taken in a similar direction, the evolution paths become long. The evolution paths are exploited in two ways. One path is used for the covariance matrix adaptation procedure in place of single successful search steps and facilitates a possibly much faster variance increase of favorable directions. The other path is used to conduct an additional step-size control. This step-size control aims to make consecutive movements of the distribution mean orthogonal in expectation. The step-size control effectively prevents premature convergence yet allowing fast convergence to an optimum.

Algorithm

In the following the most commonly used (μ/μw,&nbsp;λ)-CMA-ES is outlined, where in each iteration step a weighted combination of the μ best out of λ new candidate solutions is used to update the distribution parameters. The main loop consists of three main parts: 1) sampling of new solutions, 2) re-ordering of the sampled solutions based on their fitness, 3) update of the internal state variables based on the re-ordered samples. A pseudocode of the algorithm looks as follows.

set \lambda  // number of samples per iteration, at least two, generally > 4

initialize m, \sigma, C=I, p_\sigma=0, p_c=0  // initialize state variables

while not terminate do  // iterate

for i in \{1\ldots\lambda\} do  // sample \lambda new solutions and evaluate them

x_i ={}sample_multivariate_normal(mean{}=m, covariance_matrix{}=\sigma^2 C )

f_i = \operatorname{fitness}(x_i)

x_{1\ldots\lambda} &larr; x_{s(1)\ldots s(\lambda)} with s(i) = \operatorname{argsort}(f_{1\ldots\lambda}, i) // sort solutions

m' = m  // we need later m - m' and x_i - m'

m &larr; update_m(x_1, \ldots ,x_\lambda)  // move mean to better solutions

p_\sigma &larr; update_ps(p_\sigma,\sigma^{-1} C^{-1/2} (m - m'))  // update isotropic evolution path

p_c &larr; update_pc(p_c,\sigma^{-1}(m - m'),\|p_\sigma\|)  // update anisotropic evolution path

C &larr; update_C(C,p_c,(x_1 - m')/\sigma,\ldots ,(x_\lambda - m')/\sigma)  // update covariance matrix

\sigma &larr; update_sigma(\sigma,\|p_\sigma\|)  // update step-size using isotropic path length

return m or x_1

The order of the five update assignments is relevant: m must be updated first, p_\sigma and p_c must be updated before C, and \sigma must be updated last. The update equations for the five state variables are specified in the following.

Given are the search space dimension n and the iteration step k. The five state variables are

m_k\in\mathbb{R}^n, the distribution mean and current favorite solution to the optimization problem,

\sigma_k>0, the step-size,

C_k, a symmetric and positive-definite n\times n covariance matrix with  C_0 = I and

p_\sigma\in\mathbb{R}^n, p_c\in\mathbb{R}^n, two evolution paths, initially set to the zero vector.

The iteration starts with sampling \lambda>1 candidate solutions x_i\in\mathbb{R}^n  from a multivariate normal distribution \textstyle \mathcal{N}(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k), i.e.

for i=1,\ldots,\lambda

\begin{align}

x_i \ &\sim\ \mathcal{N}(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k)

\\&\sim\ m_k + \sigma_k\times\mathcal{N}(0,C_k)

\end{align}

The second line suggests the interpretation as unbiased perturbation (mutation) of the current favorite solution vector m_k (the distribution mean vector). The candidate solutions  x_i are evaluated on the objective function f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R} to be minimized.  Denoting the f-sorted candidate solutions as

\{x_{i:\lambda} \mid i=1\dots\lambda\} = \{x_i\mid i=1\dots\lambda\} \text{ and }

f(x_{1:\lambda})\le\dots\le f(x_{\mu:\lambda})\le f(x_{\mu+1:\lambda}) \le \cdots,

the new mean value is computed as

\begin{align}

m_{k+1} &= \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i\, x_{i:\lambda}

\\ &= m_k + \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i\, (x_{i:\lambda} - m_k)

\end{align}

where the positive (recombination) weights  w_1 \ge w_2 \ge \dots \ge w_\mu > 0 sum to one. Typically, \mu \le \lambda/2 and the weights are chosen such that \textstyle \mu_w := 1 / \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i^2 \approx \lambda/4. The only feedback used from the objective function here and in the following is an ordering of the sampled candidate solutions due to the indices i:\lambda.

The step-size \sigma_k is updated using cumulative step-size adaptation (CSA), sometimes also denoted as path length control. The evolution path (or search path) p_\sigma is updated first.

p_\sigma \gets \underbrace{(1-c_\sigma)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\text{discount factor}\!\!\!\!\!}\, p_\sigma

+ \overbrace{\sqrt{1 - (1-c_\sigma)^2}}^{

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\text{complements for discounted variance}

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \underbrace{\sqrt{\mu_w}

\,C_k^{\;-1/2} \, \frac{\overbrace{m_{k+1} - m_k}^{\!\!\!\text{displacement of } m\!\!\!}}{\sigma_k}}_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

\text{distributed as } \mathcal{N}(0,I) \text{ under neutral selection}

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!}

\sigma_{k+1} = \sigma_k \times \exp\bigg(\frac{c_\sigma}{d_\sigma}

\underbrace{\left(\frac{\|p_\sigma\|}{\operatorname E\|\mathcal{N}(0,I)\|} - 1\right)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

\text{unbiased about 0 under neutral selection}

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

}\bigg)

where

c_\sigma^{-1}\approx n/3 is the backward time horizon for the evolution path p_\sigma and larger than one (c_\sigma \ll 1 is reminiscent of an exponential decay constant as (1-c_\sigma)^k\approx\exp(-c_\sigma k) where c_\sigma^{-1} is the associated lifetime and c_\sigma^{-1}\ln(2)\approx0.7c_\sigma^{-1} the half-life),

\mu_w=\left(\sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i^2\right)^{-1} is the variance effective selection mass and 1 \le \mu_w \le \mu by definition of w_i,

C_k^{\;-1/2} = \sqrt{C_k}^{\;-1} = \sqrt{C_k^{\;-1}} is the unique symmetric square root of the inverse of C_k, and

d_\sigma is the damping parameter usually close to one. For d_\sigma=\infty or c_\sigma=0 the step-size remains unchanged.

The step-size \sigma_k is increased if and only if \|p_\sigma\| is larger than the expected value

\begin{align}

\operatorname E\|\mathcal{N}(0,I)\| &= \sqrt{2} \; \frac{\Gamma((n+1)/2)}{\Gamma(n/2)} \\[1ex]

&\approx \sqrt{n}\, \left(1 - \frac{1}{4 n} + \frac{1}{21\,n^2}\right)

\end{align}

and decreased if it is smaller. For this reason, the step-size update tends to make consecutive steps C_k^{-1}-conjugate, in that  after the adaptation has been successful \textstyle\left(\frac{m_{k+2}-m_{k+1}}{\sigma_{k+1}}\right)^T\! C_k^{-1} \frac{m_{k+1}-m_{k}}{\sigma_k} \approx 0.

Finally, the covariance matrix is updated, where again the respective evolution path is updated first.

p_c \gets \underbrace{(1-c_c)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\text{discount factor}\!\!\!\!\!}\,

p_c +

\underbrace{\mathbf{1}_{[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]}(\|p_\sigma\|)}_{\text{indicator function}}

\overbrace{\sqrt{1 - (1-c_c)^2}}^{

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\text{complements for discounted variance}

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!}

\underbrace{\sqrt{\mu_w}

\, \frac{m_{k+1} - m_k}{\sigma_k}}_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!

\text{distributed as}\; \mathcal{N}(0,C_k)\;\text{under neutral selection}

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!}

C_{k+1} = \underbrace{(1 - c_1 - c_\mu + c_s)}_{\!\!\!\!\!\text{discount factor}\!\!\!\!\!}

\, C_k + c_1 \underbrace{p_c p_c^T}_{

\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!}

+ \,c_\mu \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k}

\left( \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \right)^T}_{

\operatorname{rank} \min(\mu,n) \text{ matrix}}

where T denotes the transpose and

c_c^{-1}\approx n/4 is the backward time horizon for the evolution path p_c and larger than one,

\alpha\approx 1.5 and the indicator function \mathbf{1}_{[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]}(\|p_\sigma\|) evaluates to one if and only if \|p_\sigma\|\in[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}] or, in other words, \|p_\sigma\|\le\alpha\sqrt{n}, which is usually the case,

c_s = (1 - \mathbf{1}_{[0,\alpha\sqrt{n}]}(\|p_\sigma\|)^2) \,c_1 c_c (2-c_c)  makes partly up for the small variance loss in case the indicator is zero,

c_1 \approx 2 / n^2 is the learning rate for the rank-one update of the covariance matrix and

c_\mu \approx \mu_w / n^2  is the learning rate for the rank-\mu update of the covariance matrix and must not exceed 1 - c_1.

The covariance matrix update tends to increase the likelihood for p_c and for (x_{i:\lambda} - m_k)/\sigma_k to be sampled from \mathcal{N}(0,C_{k+1}). This completes the iteration step.

The number of candidate samples per iteration, \lambda, is not determined a priori and can vary in a wide range. Smaller values, for example \lambda=10, lead to more local search behavior. Larger values, for example \lambda=10n with default value \mu_w \approx \lambda/4, render the search more global. Sometimes the algorithm is repeatedly restarted with increasing \lambda by a factor of two for each restart. Besides of setting \lambda (or possibly \mu instead, if for example \lambda is predetermined by the number of available processors), the above introduced parameters are not specific to the given objective function and therefore not meant to be modified by the user.

Theoretical foundations

Given the distribution parameters&mdash;mean, variances and covariances&mdash;the normal probability distribution for sampling new candidate solutions is the maximum entropy probability distribution over \mathbb{R}^n, that is, the sample distribution with the minimal amount of prior information built into the distribution. More considerations on the update equations of CMA-ES are made in the following.

Variable metric

The CMA-ES implements a stochastic variable-metric method. In the very particular case of a convex-quadratic objective function

f(x) = {\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(x-x^*)^T H (x-x^*)

the covariance matrix C_k adapts to the inverse of the Hessian matrix H, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations. More general, also on the function g \circ f, where  g  is strictly increasing and therefore order preserving, the covariance matrix C_k adapts to H^{-1}, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations.

For selection ratio \lambda/\mu\to\infty (and hence population size \lambda\to\infty), the \mu selected solutions yield an empirical covariance matrix reflective of the inverse-Hessian even in evolution strategies without adaptation of the covariance matrix. This result has been proven for \mu=1 on a static model, relying on the quadratic approximation.

Maximum-likelihood updates

The update equations for mean and covariance matrix maximize a likelihood while resembling an expectation–maximization algorithm. The update of the mean vector m maximizes a log-likelihood, such that

m_{k+1} = \arg\max_m \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \log p_\mathcal{N}(x_{i:\lambda} \mid m)

where

\log p_\mathcal{N}(x) =

- \tfrac{1}{2} \log\det(2\pi C) - \tfrac{1}{2} (x-m)^T C^{-1} (x-m)

denotes the log-likelihood of x from a multivariate normal distribution with mean m and any positive definite covariance matrix C. To see that m_{k+1} is independent of C remark first that this is the case for any diagonal matrix C, because the coordinate-wise maximizer is independent of a scaling factor. Then, rotation of the data points or choosing C non-diagonal are equivalent.

The rank-\mu update of the covariance matrix, that is, the right most summand in the update equation of C_k, maximizes a log-likelihood in that

\sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k}

\left( \frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \right)^T

= \arg\max_{C} \sum_{i=1}^\mu w_i \log p_\mathcal{N}\left(\left.\frac{x_{i:\lambda} - m_k}{\sigma_k} \right| C\right)

for \mu\ge n (otherwise C is singular, but substantially the same result holds for \mu ). Here,  p_\mathcal{N}(x | C)  denotes the likelihood of x from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix C. Therefore, for c_1=0 and c_\mu=1, C_{k+1} is the above maximum-likelihood estimator. See estimation of covariance matrices for details on the derivation.

Natural gradient descent in the space of sample distributions

Akimoto et al. and Glasmachers et al. discovered independently that the update of the distribution parameters resembles the descent in direction of a sampled natural gradient of the expected objective function value E f(x) (to be minimized), where the expectation is taken under the sample distribution. With the parameter setting of c_\sigma=0 and c_1=0, i.e. without step-size control and rank-one update, CMA-ES can thus be viewed as an instantiation of Natural Evolution Strategies (NES).

finally found a rigorous derivation for the weights, w_i, as they are defined in the CMA-ES. The weights are an asymptotically consistent estimator of the CDF of f(X) at the points of the ith order statistic f(x_{i:\lambda}), as defined above, where X\sim p(.|\theta), composed with a fixed monotonically decreasing transformation w, that is,

w_i = w\left(\frac{\mathsf{rank}(f(x_{i:\lambda})) - 1/2}{\lambda}\right).

These weights make the algorithm insensitive to the specific f-values. More concisely, using the CDF estimator of f instead of f itself let the algorithm only depend on the ranking of f-values but not on their underlying distribution. This renders the algorithm invariant to strictly increasing f-transformations. Now we define

\theta = [m_k^T \operatorname{vec}(C_k)^T \sigma_k]^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n+n^2+1}

such that  p(\cdot\mid\theta)  is the density of the multivariate normal distribution \mathcal N(m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k). Then, we have an explicit expression for the inverse of the Fisher information matrix where \sigma_k is fixed

F^{-1}_{\theta \mid \sigma_k} = \left[\begin{array}{cc}\sigma_k^2 C_k&0\\ 0&2 C_k\otimes C_k\end{array}\right]

and for

\begin{align}

\ln p(x\mid\theta) &= \ln p(x\mid m_k,\sigma_k^2 C_k) \\[1ex]

&= -\tfrac{1}{2}(x-m_k)^T \sigma_k^{-2} C_k^{-1} (x-m_k) - \tfrac{1}{2}\ln\det(2\pi\sigma_k^2 C_k)

\end{align}

and, after some calculations, the updates in the CMA-ES turn out as

This adaptive encoding procedure is not confined to algorithms that sample from a multivariate normal distribution (like evolution strategies), but can in principle be applied to any iterative search method.

Performance in practice

In contrast to most other evolutionary algorithms, the CMA-ES is, from the user's perspective, quasi-parameter-free. The user has to choose an initial solution point, m_0\in\mathbb{R}^n, and the initial step-size, \sigma_0>0. Optionally, the number of candidate samples λ (population size) can be modified by the user in order to change the characteristic search behavior (see above) and termination conditions can or should be adjusted to the problem at hand.

The CMA-ES has been empirically successful in various applications and is considered to be particularly useful on non-convex, non-separable, ill-conditioned, multi-modal or noisy objective functions. One survey of Black-Box optimizations found it outranked 31 other optimization algorithms, performing especially strongly on "difficult functions" or larger-dimensional search spaces.

The search space dimension ranges typically between two and a few hundred. Assuming a black-box optimization scenario, where gradients are not available (or not useful) and function evaluations are the only considered cost of search, the CMA-ES method is likely to be outperformed by other methods in the following conditions:

on low-dimensional functions, say n , for example by the downhill simplex method or surrogate-based methods (like kriging with expected improvement);

on separable functions without or with only negligible dependencies between the design variables in particular in the case of multi-modality or large dimension, for example by differential evolution;

on (nearly) convex-quadratic functions with low or moderate condition number of the Hessian matrix, where BFGS or NEWUOA or SLSQP are typically at least ten times faster;

on functions that can already be solved with a comparatively small number of function evaluations, say no more than 10 n, where CMA-ES is often slower than, for example, NEWUOA or Multilevel Coordinate Search (MCS).

On separable functions, the performance disadvantage is likely to be most significant in that CMA-ES might not be able to find at all comparable solutions. On the other hand, on non-separable functions that are ill-conditioned or rugged or can only be solved with more than 100 n function evaluations, the CMA-ES shows most often superior performance.

Variations and extensions

The (1+1)-CMA-ES generates only one candidate solution per iteration step which becomes the new distribution mean if it is better than the current mean. For c_c=1 the (1+1)-CMA-ES is a close variant of Gaussian adaptation. Some Natural Evolution Strategies are close variants of the CMA-ES with specific parameter settings. Natural Evolution Strategies do not utilize evolution paths (that means in CMA-ES setting c_c=c_\sigma=1) and they formalize the update of variances and covariances on a Cholesky factor instead of a covariance matrix. The CMA-ES has also been extended to multiobjective optimization as MO-CMA-ES. Another remarkable extension has been the addition of a negative update of the covariance matrix with the so-called active CMA.

Using the additional active CMA update is considered as the default variant nowadays.
