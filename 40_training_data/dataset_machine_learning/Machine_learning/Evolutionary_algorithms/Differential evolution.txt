Differential evolution (DE) is an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. Such methods are commonly known as metaheuristics as they make few or no assumptions about the optimized problem and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found.

DE is used for multidimensional real-valued functions but does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means DE does not require the optimization problem to be differentiable, as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods. DE can therefore also be used on optimization problems that are not even continuous, are noisy, change over time, etc.

Algorithm

A basic variant of the DE algorithm works by having a population of candidate solutions (called agents). These agents are moved around in the search-space by using simple mathematical formulae to combine the positions of existing agents from the population. If the new position of an agent is an improvement then it is accepted and forms part of the population, otherwise the new position is simply discarded. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered.

Formally, let f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} be the fitness function which must be minimized (note that maximization can be performed by considering the function h := -f instead). The function takes a candidate solution as argument in the form of a vector of real numbers. It produces a real number as output which indicates the fitness of the given candidate solution. The gradient of f is not known. The goal is to find a solution \mathbf{m} for which f(\mathbf{m}) \leq f(\mathbf{p}) for all \mathbf{p} in the search-space, which means that \mathbf{m} is the global minimum.

Let \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n designate a candidate solution (agent) in the population. The basic DE algorithm can then be described as follows:

Choose the parameters \text{NP} \geq 4, \text{CR} \in [0,1], and F \in [0,2].

NP : \text{NP}  is the population size, i.e. the number of candidate agents or "parents".

CR : The parameter \text{CR} \in [0,1] is called the crossover probability.

F : The parameter F \in [0,2] is called the differential weight.

Typical settings are NP = 10n, CR = 0.9 and F = 0.8.

Optimization performance may be greatly impacted by these choices; see below.

Initialize all agents \mathbf{x} with random positions in the search-space.

Until a termination criterion is met (e.g. number of iterations performed, or adequate fitness reached), repeat the following:

For each agent \mathbf{x} in the population do:

Pick three agents \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}, and \mathbf{c} from the population at random, they must be distinct from each other as well as from agent \mathbf{x}. (\mathbf{a} is called the "base" vector.)

Pick a random index R \in \{1, \ldots, n\} where n is the dimensionality of the problem being optimized.

Compute the agent's potentially new position \mathbf{y} = [y_1, \ldots, y_n] as follows:

For each i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}, pick a uniformly distributed random number r_i \sim U(0,1)

If r_i  or i = R then set y_i = a_i + F \times (b_i-c_i) otherwise set y_i = x_i. (Index position R is replaced for certain.)

If f(\mathbf{y}) \leq f(\mathbf{x}) then replace the agent \mathbf{x} in the population with the improved or equal candidate solution \mathbf{y}.

Pick the agent from the population that has the best fitness and return it as the best found candidate solution.

Parameter selection

The choice of DE parameters \text{NP}, \text{CR} and F can have a large impact on optimization performance.  Selecting the DE parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research. Rules of thumb for parameter selection were devised by Storn et al. The following directions of development can be outlined:
