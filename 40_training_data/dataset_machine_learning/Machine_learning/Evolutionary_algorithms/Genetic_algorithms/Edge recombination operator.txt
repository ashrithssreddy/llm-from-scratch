The edge recombination operator (ERO) is an operator that creates a path that is similar to a set of existing paths (parents) by looking at the edges rather than the vertices. The main application of this is for crossover in genetic algorithms when a genotype with non-repeating gene sequences is needed such as for the travelling salesman problem. It was described by Darrell Whitley and others in 1989.

Algorithm

ERO is based on an adjacency lists, which lists the neighbors of each node in any parent.

For example, in a travelling salesman problem such as the one depicted, the node map for the parents CABDEF and ABCEFD (see illustration) is generated by taking the first parent, say, 'ABCEFD' and recording its immediate neighbors, including those that roll around the end of the string.

Therefore;

... -> [A]  [B]  [C]  [E]  [F]  [D]  A. We remove A from all the neighbor sets, and find that the smallest of B, C and D is B={C,D}.

AB. The smallest sets of C and D are C={E,F} and D={E,F}. We randomly select D.

ABD. Smallest are E={C,F}, F={C,E}. We pick F.

ABDF. C={E}, E={C}. We pick C.

ABDFC. The smallest set is E={}.

ABDFCE. The length of the child is now the same as the parent, so we are done.

Note that the only edge introduced in ABDFCE is AE.

Comparison with other operators

Edge recombination is generally considered a good option for problems like the travelling salesman problem. In a 1999 study at the University of the Basque Country, edge recombination provided better results than all the other crossover operators including partially mapped crossover and cycle crossover.
