In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion-based generative models or score-based generative models, are a class of latent variable generative models. A diffusion model consists of two major components: the forward diffusion process, and the reverse sampling process. The goal of diffusion models is to learn a diffusion process for a given dataset, such that the process can generate new elements that are distributed similarly as the original dataset. A diffusion model models data as generated by a diffusion process, whereby a new datum performs a random walk with drift through the space of all possible data. They are typically trained using variational inference. The model is trained to reverse the process of adding noise to an image. After training to convergence, it can be used for image generation by starting with an image composed of random noise, and applying the network iteratively to denoise the image.

Diffusion-based image generators have seen widespread commercial interest, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E. These models typically combine diffusion models with other models, such as text-encoders and cross-attention modules to allow text-conditioned generation. such as text generation and summarization, sound generation, and reinforcement learning.

Denoising diffusion model

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics

Diffusion models were introduced in 2015 as a method to train a model that can sample from a highly complex probability distribution. They used techniques from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, especially diffusion.

Consider, for example, how one might model the distribution of all naturally occurring photos. Each image is a point in the space of all images, and the distribution of naturally occurring photos is a "cloud" in space, which, by repeatedly adding noise to the images, diffuses out to the rest of the image space, until the cloud becomes all but indistinguishable from a Gaussian distribution \mathcal{N}(0, I). A model that can approximately undo the diffusion can then be used to sample from the original distribution. This is studied in "non-equilibrium" thermodynamics, as the starting distribution is not in equilibrium, unlike the final distribution.

The equilibrium distribution is the Gaussian distribution \mathcal{N}(0, I), with pdf \rho(x) \propto e^{-\frac 12 \|x\|^2}. This is just the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of particles in a potential well V(x) = \frac 12 \|x\|^2 at temperature 1. The initial distribution, being very much out of equilibrium, would diffuse towards the equilibrium distribution, making biased random steps that are a sum of pure randomness (like a Brownian walker) and gradient descent down the potential well. The randomness is necessary: if the particles were to undergo only gradient descent, then they will all fall to the origin, collapsing the distribution.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)

The 2020 paper proposed the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which improves upon the previous method by variational inference.

Forward diffusion

To present the model, some notation is required.

\beta_1, ..., \beta_T \in (0, 1) are fixed constants.

\alpha_t := 1-\beta_t

\bar \alpha_t := \alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_t

\sigma_t := \sqrt{1 -\bar \alpha_t}

\tilde \sigma_t := \frac{\sigma_{t-1}}{\sigma_{t}}\sqrt{\beta_t}

\tilde\mu_t(x_t, x_0) :=\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_{t}}(1-\bar \alpha_{t-1})x_t +\sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}}(1-\alpha_{t})x_0}{\sigma_{t}^2}

\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma) is the normal distribution with mean \mu and variance \Sigma, and \mathcal{N}(x | \mu, \Sigma) is the probability density at x.

A vertical bar denotes conditioning.

A forward diffusion process starts at some starting point x_0 \sim q, where q is the probability distribution to be learned, then repeatedly adds noise to it byx_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} z_twhere z_1, ..., z_T are IID (Independent and identically distributed random variables) samples from \mathcal{N}(0, I). The coefficients \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} and \sqrt{\beta_t} ensure that \mbox{Var}(X_t) = I assuming that \mbox{Var}(X_0) = I. The values of \beta_t are chosen such that for any starting distribution of x_0, if it has finite second moment, then \lim_{t\to\infty} x_t|x_0 converges to \mathcal{N}(0, I).

The entire diffusion process then satisfiesq(x_{0:T}) = q(x_0)q(x_1|x_0) \cdots q(x_T|x_{T-1}) = q(x_0) \mathcal{N}(x_1 | \sqrt{\alpha_1} x_0, \beta_1 I) \cdots \mathcal{N}(x_T | \sqrt{\alpha_T} x_{T-1}, \beta_T I)or\ln q(x_{0:T}) = \ln q(x_0) - \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{2\beta_t} \| x_t - \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}\|^2 + Cwhere C is a normalization constant and often omitted. In particular, we note that x_{1:T}|x_0 is a Gaussian process, which affords us considerable freedom in reparameterization. For example, by standard manipulation with Gaussian process, x_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}, \sigma_{t}^2 I \right)x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde\sigma_t^2 I)In particular, notice that for large t, the variable x_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}, \sigma_{t}^2 I \right) converges to \mathcal{N}(0, I). That is, after a long enough diffusion process, we end up with some x_T that is very close to \mathcal{N}(0, I), with all traces of the original x_0 \sim q gone.

For example, sincex_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}, \sigma_{t}^2 I \right)we can sample x_{t}|x_0 directly "in one step", instead of going through all the intermediate steps x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1}.

{{Math proof|title=Derivation by reparameterization|proof=

We know x_{t-1}|x_0 is a Gaussian, and x_t|x_{t-1} is another Gaussian. We also know that these are independent. Thus we can perform a reparameterization: x_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{t-1}} x_{0} + \sqrt{1 - \bar\alpha_{t-1}} z x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t} z' where z, z' are IID Gaussians.

There are 5 variables x_0, x_{t-1}, x_t, z, z' and two linear equations. The two sources of randomness are z, z', which can be reparameterized by rotation, since the IID Gaussian distribution is rotationally symmetric.

By plugging in the equations, we can solve for the first reparameterization: x_t = \sqrt{\bar \alpha_t}x_0 + \underbrace{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}z + \sqrt{1-\alpha_t}z'}_{= \sigma_t z} where z is a Gaussian with mean zero and variance one.

To find the second one, we complete the rotational matrix: \begin{bmatrix}z \\z'\end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}}{\sigma_t} & \frac{\sqrt{\beta_t}}{\sigma_t} \\?&?\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix} z\\z'\end{bmatrix}

Since rotational matrices are all of the form \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta\\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}, we know the matrix must be \begin{bmatrix}z \\z'\end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}}{\sigma_t} & \frac{\sqrt{\beta_t}}{\sigma_t} \\- \frac{\sqrt{\beta_t}}{\sigma_t} & \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}}{\sigma_t}

\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix} z\\z'\end{bmatrix} and since the inverse of rotational matrix is its transpose,

\begin{bmatrix}z \\z'\end{bmatrix} =

\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}}{\sigma_t} & -\frac{\sqrt{\beta_t}}{\sigma_t} \\ \frac{\sqrt{\beta_t}}{\sigma_t} & \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t - \bar\alpha_t}}{\sigma_t}

\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix} z\\z'\end{bmatrix}

Plugging back, and simplifying, we have x_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}x_0 + \sigma_tz x_{t-1} = \tilde\mu_t(x_t, x_0) - \tilde\sigma_t z'

}}

Backward diffusion

The key idea of DDPM is to use a neural network parametrized by \theta. The network takes in two arguments x_t, t, and outputs a vector \mu_\theta(x_t, t) and a matrix \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t), such that each step in the forward diffusion process can be approximately undone by x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)). This then gives us a backward diffusion process p_\theta defined byp_\theta(x_T) = \mathcal{N}(x_T | 0, I)p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1} | \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))The goal now is to learn the parameters such that p_\theta(x_0) is as close to q(x_0) as possible. To do that, we use maximum likelihood estimation with variational inference.

Variational inference

The ELBO inequality states that \ln p_\theta(x_0) \geq E_{x_{1:T}\sim q(\cdot | x_0)}[ \ln p_\theta(x_{0:T}) - \ln q(x_{1:T}|x_0)] , and taking one more expectation, we getE_{x_0 \sim q}[\ln p_\theta(x_0)] \geq E_{x_{0:T}\sim q}[ \ln p_\theta(x_{0:T}) - \ln q(x_{1:T}|x_0)] We see that maximizing the quantity on the right would give us a lower bound on the likelihood of observed data. This allows us to perform variational inference.

Define the loss functionL(\theta) := -E_{x_{0:T}\sim q}[ \ln p_\theta(x_{0:T}) - \ln q(x_{1:T}|x_0)]and now the goal is to minimize the loss by stochastic gradient descent. The expression may be simplified toL(\theta) = \sum_{t=1}^T E_{x_{t-1}, x_t\sim q}[-\ln p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)] + E_{x_0 \sim q}[D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) \| p_\theta(x_T))] + Cwhere C does not depend on the parameter, and thus can be ignored. Since p_\theta(x_T) = \mathcal{N}(x_T | 0, I) also does not depend on the parameter, the term E_{x_0 \sim q}[D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) \| p_\theta(x_T))] can also be ignored. This leaves just L(\theta ) = \sum_{t=1}^T L_t with L_t =  E_{x_{t-1}, x_t\sim q}[-\ln p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)] to be minimized.

Noise prediction network

Since x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde\sigma_t^2 I), this suggests that we should use \mu_\theta(x_t, t) = \tilde \mu_t(x_t, x_0); however, the network does not have access to x_0, and so it has to estimate it instead. Now, since x_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}, \sigma_{t}^2 I \right), we may write x_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0} + \sigma_t z, where z is some unknown Gaussian noise. Now we see that estimating x_0 is equivalent to estimating z.

Therefore, let the network output a noise vector \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t), and let it predict\mu_\theta(x_t, t) =\tilde\mu_t\left(x_t, \frac{x_t - \sigma_t \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)}{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}}\right) = \frac{x_t - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)  \beta_t/\sigma_t}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}It remains to design \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t). The DDPM paper suggested not learning it (since it resulted in "unstable training and poorer sample quality"), but fixing it at some value \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t) = \zeta_t^2 I, where either \zeta_t^2 = \beta_t \text{ or } \tilde\sigma_t^2 yielded similar performance.

With this, the loss simplifies to L_t = \frac{\beta_t^2}{2\alpha_t\sigma_{t}^2\zeta_t^2} E_{x_0\sim q; z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)}\left[ \left\| \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) - z \right\|^2\right] + Cwhich may be minimized by stochastic gradient descent. The paper noted empirically that an even simpler loss functionL_{simple, t} = E_{x_0\sim q; z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)}\left[ \left\| \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) - z \right\|^2\right]resulted in better models.

Backward diffusion process

After a noise prediction network is trained, it can be used for generating data points in the original distribution in a loop as follows:

Compute the noise estimate \epsilon \leftarrow \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)

Compute the original data estimate \tilde x_0 \leftarrow (x_t - \sigma_t \epsilon) / \sqrt{\bar \alpha_t}

Sample the previous data x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu_t(x_t, \tilde x_0), \tilde\sigma_t^2 I)

Change time t \leftarrow t-1

Score-based generative model

Score-based generative model is another formulation of diffusion modelling. They are also called noise conditional score network (NCSN) or score-matching with Langevin dynamics (SMLD).

Score matching

The idea of score functions

Consider the problem of image generation. Let x represent an image, and let q(x) be the probability distribution over all possible images. If we have q(x) itself, then we can say for certain how likely a certain image is. However, this is intractable in general.

Most often, we are uninterested in knowing the absolute probability of a certain image. Instead, we are usually only interested in knowing how likely a certain image is compared to its immediate neighbors — e.g. how much more likely is an image of cat compared to some small variants of it? Is it more likely if the image contains two whiskers, or three, or with some Gaussian noise added?

Consequently, we are actually quite uninterested in q(x) itself, but rather, \nabla_x \ln q(x). This has two major effects:

One, we no longer need to normalize q(x), but can use any \tilde q(x) = Cq(x), where C = \int \tilde q(x) dx > 0 is any unknown constant that is of no concern to us.

Two, we are comparing q(x) neighbors q(x + dx), by \frac{q(x)}{q(x+dx)} =e^{-\langle \nabla_x \ln q, dx \rangle}

Let the score function be s(x) := \nabla_x \ln q(x); then consider what we can do with s(x).

As it turns out, s(x) allows us to sample from q(x) using thermodynamics. Specifically, if we have a potential energy function U(x) = -\ln q(x), and a lot of particles in the potential well, then the distribution at thermodynamic equilibrium is the Boltzmann distribution q_U(x) \propto e^{-U(x)/k_B T} = q(x)^{1/k_BT}. At temperature k_BT=1, the Boltzmann distribution is exactly q(x).

Therefore, to model q(x), we may start with a particle sampled at any convenient distribution (such as the standard Gaussian distribution), then simulate the motion of the particle forwards according to the Langevin equation

dx_{t}= -\nabla_{x_t}U(x_t) d t+d W_t

and the Boltzmann distribution is, by Fokker-Planck equation, the unique thermodynamic equilibrium. So no matter what distribution x_0 has, the distribution of x_t converges in distribution to q as t\to \infty.

Learning the score function

Given a density q, we wish to learn a score function approximation f_\theta \approx \nabla \ln q. This is score matching. Typically, score matching is formalized as minimizing Fisher divergence function E_q[\|f_\theta(x) - \nabla \ln q(x)\|^2]. By expanding the integral, and performing an integration by parts, E_q[\|f_\theta(x) - \nabla \ln q(x)\|^2] = E_q[\|f_\theta\|^2 + 2\nabla\cdot f_\theta] + Cgiving us a loss function, also known as the Hyvärinen scoring rule, that can be minimized by stochastic gradient descent.

Annealing the score function

Suppose we need to model the distribution of images, and we want x_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), a white-noise image. Now, most white-noise images do not look like real images, so q(x_0) \approx 0 for large swaths of x_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I). This presents a problem for learning the score function, because if there are no samples around a certain point, then we can't learn the score function at that point. If we do not know the score function \nabla_{x_t}\ln q(x_t) at that point, then we cannot impose the time-evolution equation on a particle:dx_{t}= \nabla_{x_t}\ln q(x_t) d t+d W_tTo deal with this problem, we perform annealing. If q is too different from a white-noise distribution, then progressively add noise until it is indistinguishable from one. That is, we perform a forward diffusion, then learn the score function, then use the score function to perform a backward diffusion.

Continuous diffusion processes

Forward diffusion process

Consider again the forward diffusion process, but this time in continuous time:x_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} z_tBy taking the \beta_t \to \beta(t)dt, \sqrt{dt}z_t \to dW_t limit, we obtain a continuous diffusion process, in the form of a stochastic differential equation:dx_t = -\frac 12 \beta(t) x_t dt + \sqrt{\beta(t)} dW_twhere W_t is a Wiener process (multidimensional Brownian motion).

Now, the equation is exactly a special case of the overdamped Langevin equationdx_t = -\frac{D}{k_BT} (\nabla_x U)dt + \sqrt{2D}dW_twhere D is diffusion tensor, T is temperature, and U is potential energy field. If we substitute in D= \frac 12 \beta(t)I, k_BT = 1, U = \frac 12 \|x\|^2, we recover the above equation. This explains why the phrase "Langevin dynamics" is sometimes used in diffusion models.

Now the above equation is for the stochastic motion of a single particle. Suppose we have a cloud of particles distributed according to q at time t=0, then after a long time, the cloud of particles would settle into the stable distribution of \mathcal{N}(0, I). Let \rho_t be the density of the cloud of particles at time t, then we have\rho_0 = q; \quad \rho_T \approx \mathcal{N}(0, I)and the goal is to somehow reverse the process, so that we can start at the end and diffuse back to the beginning.

By Fokker-Planck equation, the density of the cloud evolves according to\partial_t \ln \rho_t = \frac 12 \beta(t) \left(

n + (x+ \nabla\ln\rho_t) \cdot \nabla \ln\rho_t + \Delta\ln\rho_t

\right)where n is the dimension of space, and \Delta is the Laplace operator. Equivalently,\partial_t \rho_t = \frac 12 \beta(t) ( \nabla\cdot(x\rho_t) + \Delta \rho_t)

Backward diffusion process

If we have solved \rho_t for time t\in [0, T], then we can exactly reverse the evolution of the cloud. Suppose we start with another cloud of particles with density \nu_0 = \rho_T, and let the particles in the cloud evolve according to

dy_t =  \frac{1}{2} \beta(T-t) y_{t} d t + \beta(T-t) \underbrace{\nabla_{y_{t}} \ln \rho_{T-t}\left(y_{t}\right)}_{\text {score function }} d t+\sqrt{\beta(T-t)} d W_t

then by plugging into the Fokker-Planck equation, we find that \partial_t \rho_{T-t} = \partial_t \nu_t. Thus this cloud of points is the original cloud, evolving backwards.

Noise conditional score network (NCSN)

At the continuous limit,

\bar \alpha_t = (1-\beta_1) \cdots (1-\beta_t) = e^{\sum_i \ln(1-\beta_i)} \to e^{-\int_0^t \beta(t)dt}

and so

x_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(e^{-\frac 12\int_0^t \beta(t)dt} x_{0}, \left(1- e^{-\int_0^t \beta(t)dt}\right) I \right)

In particular, we see that we can directly sample from any point in the continuous diffusion process without going through the intermediate steps, by first sampling x_0 \sim q, z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), then get x_t = e^{-\frac 12\int_0^t \beta(t)dt} x_{0} + \left(1- e^{-\int_0^t \beta(t)dt}\right) z. That is, we can quickly sample x_t \sim \rho_t for any t \geq 0.

Now, define a certain probability distribution \gamma over [0, \infty), then the score-matching loss function is defined as the expected Fisher divergence:

L(\theta) = E_{t\sim \gamma, x_t \sim \rho_t}[\|f_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2 + 2\nabla\cdot f_\theta(x_t, t)]

After training, f_\theta(x_t, t) \approx \nabla \ln\rho_t, so we can perform the backwards diffusion process by first sampling x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I), then integrating the SDE from t=T to t=0:

x_{t-dt}=x_t + \frac{1}{2} \beta(t) x_{t} d t + \beta(t) f_\theta(x_t, t) d t+\sqrt{\beta(t)} d W_t

This may be done by any SDE integration method, such as Euler–Maruyama method.

The name "noise conditional score network" is explained thus:

"network", because f_\theta is implemented as a neural network.

"score", because the output of the network is interpreted as approximating the score function \nabla\ln\rho_t.

"noise conditional", because \rho_t is equal to \rho_0 blurred by an added Gaussian noise that increases with time, and so the score function depends on the amount of noise added.

Their equivalence

DDPM and score-based generative models are equivalent. This means that a network trained using DDPM can be used as a NCSN, and vice versa.

We know that x_{t}|x_0 \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}, \sigma_{t}^2 I\right), so by Tweedie's formula, we have

\nabla_{x_t}\ln q(x_t) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{t}^2}(-x_t + \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} E_q[x_0|x_t])

As described previously, the DDPM loss function is \sum_t L_{simple, t} with

L_{simple, t} = E_{x_0\sim q; z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)}\left[ \left\| \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) - z \right\|^2\right]

where x_t =\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0} + \sigma_tz

. By a change of variables,

L_{simple, t} = E_{x_0, x_t\sim q}\left[ \left\| \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) -

\frac{x_t -\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}}{\sigma_t} \right\|^2\right] = E_{x_t\sim q, x_0\sim q(\cdot | x_t)}\left[ \left\| \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) -

\frac{x_t -\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_{0}}{\sigma_t} \right\|^2\right]

and the term inside becomes a least squares regression, so if the network actually reaches the global minimum of loss, then we have \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) = \frac{x_t -\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} E_q[x_0|x_t]}{\sigma_t} = -\sigma_t\nabla_{x_t}\ln q(x_t)

Thus, given a good score-based network, its predicted score is a good prediction of the noise (after scaling by \sigma_t), and thus can be used for denoising.

Conversely, the continuous limit x_{t-1} = x_{t-dt}, \beta_t = \beta(t) dt, z_t\sqrt{dt} = dW_t of the backward equation

x_{t-1} = \frac{x_t}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}- \frac{ \beta_t}{\sigma_{t}\sqrt{\alpha_t }} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) + \sqrt{\beta_t} z_t; \quad z_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)

gives us precisely the same equation as score-based diffusion:

x_{t-dt} = x_t(1+\beta(t)dt / 2) + \beta(t) \nabla_{x_t}\ln q(x_t) dt + \sqrt{\beta(t)}dW_tThus, at infinitesimal steps of DDPM, a denoising network performs score-based diffusion.

Main variants

Noise schedule

In DDPM, the sequence of numbers 0 = \sigma_0  is called a (discrete time) noise schedule. In general, consider a strictly increasing monotonic function \sigma of type \R \to (0, 1), such as the sigmoid function. In that case, a noise schedule is a sequence of real numbers \lambda_1 . It then defines a sequence of noises \sigma_t := \sigma(\lambda_t), which then derives the other quantities \beta_t = 1 - \frac{1 - \sigma_t^2}{1 - \sigma_{t-1}^2}.

In order to use arbitrary noise schedules, instead of training a noise prediction model \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t), one trains \epsilon_\theta(x_t, \sigma_t).

Similarly, for the noise conditional score network, instead of training f_\theta(x_t, t), one trains f_\theta(x_t, \sigma_t).

Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM)

The original DDPM method for generating images is slow, since the forward diffusion process usually takes T \sim 1000 to make the distribution of x_T to appear close to Gaussian. However this means the backward diffusion process also take 1000 steps. Unlike the forward diffusion process, which can skip steps as x_t | x_0 is Gaussian for all t \geq 1, the backward diffusion process does not allow skipping steps. For example, to sample x_{t-2}|x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(x_{t-1}, t-1), \Sigma_\theta(x_{t-1}, t-1)) requires the model to first sample x_{t-1}. Attempting to directly sample x_{t-2}|x_t would require us to marginalize out x_{t-1}, which is generally intractable.

DDIM is a method to take any model trained on DDPM loss, and use it to sample with some steps skipped, sacrificing an adjustable amount of quality. If we generate the Markovian chain case in DDPM to non-Markovian case, DDIM corresponds to the case that the reverse process has variance equals to 0. In other words, the reverse process (and also the forward process) is deterministic. When using fewer sampling steps, DDIM outperforms DDPM.

In detail, the DDIM sampling method is as follows. Start with the forward diffusion process x_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_0 + \sigma_t \epsilon. Then, during the backward denoising process, given x_t, \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t), the original data is estimated as x_0' = \frac{x_t -  \sigma_t \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)}{ \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}}then the backward diffusion process can jump to any step 0 \leq s , and the next denoised sample is x_{s} = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_{s}} x_0'

+ \sqrt{\sigma_{s}^2 - (\sigma'_s)^2} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)

+ \sigma_s' \epsilonwhere \sigma_s' is an arbitrary real number within the range [0, \sigma_s], and \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) is a newly sampled Gaussian noise.

The encoder-decoder pair is most often a variational autoencoder (VAE).

Architectural improvements

proposed various architectural improvements. For example, they proposed log-space interpolation during backward sampling. Instead of sampling from x_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu_t(x_t, \tilde x_0), \tilde\sigma_t^2 I), they recommended sampling from \mathcal{N}(\tilde\mu_t(x_t, \tilde x_0), (\sigma_t^v \tilde\sigma_t^{1-v})^2 I) for a learned parameter v.

In the v-prediction formalism, the noising formula x_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar\alpha_t} \epsilon_t is reparameterised by an angle \phi_t such that \cos \phi_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} and a "velocity" defined by \cos\phi_t \epsilon_t - \sin\phi_t x_0. The network is trained to predict the velocity \hat v_\theta, and denoising is by x_{\phi_t - \delta} = \cos(\delta)\;  x_{\phi_t} - \sin(\delta) \hat{v}_{\theta}\; (x_{\phi_t}) . This parameterization was found to improve performance, as the model can be trained to reach total noise (i.e. \phi_t = 90^\circ) and then reverse it, whereas the standard parameterization never reaches total noise since \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} > 0 is always true.

Classifier guidance

Classifier guidance was proposed in 2021 to improve class-conditional generation by using a classifier. The original publication used CLIP text encoders to improve text-conditional image generation.

This gives a modification to the previous equation:\nabla_x \ln p_\beta(x|y) = \nabla_x \ln p(x) + \gamma \nabla_x \ln p(y|x) For denoising models, it corresponds to

\nabla_x \ln p_\gamma(x|y) = (1-\gamma) \nabla_x \ln p(x) + \gamma \nabla_x \ln p(x|y)

Such a model is usually trained by presenting it with both (x, y)  and (x, {\rm None}) , allowing it to model both \nabla_x\ln p(x|y)  and \nabla_x\ln p(x) .

Note that for CFG, the diffusion model cannot be merely a generative model of the entire data distribution \nabla_x \ln p(x)  . It must be a conditional generative model \nabla_x \ln p(x | y)  . For example, in stable diffusion, the diffusion backbone takes as input both a noisy model x_t  , a time t  , and a conditioning vector y   (such as a vector encoding a text prompt), and produces a noise prediction \epsilon_\theta(x_t, y, t)  .

For denoising models, it corresponds to\epsilon_\theta(x_t, y, t, \gamma) = \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) + \gamma (\epsilon_\theta(x_t, y, t) - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t))As sampled by DDIM, the algorithm can be written as\begin{aligned}

\epsilon_{\text{uncond}} &\leftarrow \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \\

\epsilon_{\text{cond}} &\leftarrow \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c) \\

\epsilon_{\text{CFG}} &\leftarrow \epsilon_{\text{uncond}} + \gamma(\epsilon_{\text{cond}} - \epsilon_{\text{uncond}})\\

x_0 &\leftarrow (x_t - \sigma_t \epsilon_{\text{CFG}}) / \sqrt{1 - \sigma_t^2}\\

x_s &\leftarrow \sqrt{1 - \sigma_s^2} x_0 + \sqrt{\sigma_s^2 - (\sigma_s')^2} \epsilon_{\text{uncond}} + \sigma_s' \epsilon\\

\end{aligned}A similar technique applies to language model sampling. Also, if the unconditional generation \epsilon_{\text{uncond}} \leftarrow \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)  is replaced by \epsilon_{\text{neg cond}} \leftarrow \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t, c') , then it results in negative prompting, which pushes the generation away from c'  condition.

Samplers

Given a diffusion model, one may regard it either as a continuous process, and sample from it by integrating a SDE, or one can regard it as a discrete process, and sample from it by iterating the discrete steps. The choice of the "noise schedule" \beta_t can also affect the quality of samples. A noise schedule is a function that sends a natural number to a noise level: t \mapsto \beta_t, \quad t \in \{1, 2, \dots\}, \beta \in (0, 1)A noise schedule is more often specified by a map t \mapsto \sigma_t. The two definitions are equivalent, since \beta_t = 1 - \frac{1 - \sigma_t^2}{1 - \sigma_{t-1}^2}.

In the DDPM perspective, one can use the DDPM itself (with noise), or DDIM (with adjustable amount of noise). The case where one adds noise is sometimes called ancestral sampling. One can interpolate between noise and no noise. The amount of noise is denoted \eta ("eta value") in the DDIM paper, with \eta = 0 denoting no noise (as in deterministic DDIM), and \eta = 1 denoting full noise (as in DDPM).

In the perspective of SDE, one can use any of the numerical integration methods, such as Euler–Maruyama method, Heun's method, linear multistep methods, etc. Just as in the discrete case, one can add an adjustable amount of noise during the integration.

Notable variants include Poisson flow generative model, consistency model, critically damped Langevin diffusion, GenPhys, cold diffusion, etc.

Flow-based diffusion model

Abstractly speaking, the idea of diffusion model is to take an unknown probability distribution (the distribution of natural-looking images), then progressively convert it to a known probability distribution (standard Gaussian distribution), by building an absolutely continuous probability path connecting them. The probability path is in fact defined implicitly by the score function \nabla \ln p_t  .

In denoising diffusion models, the forward process adds noise, and the backward process removes noise. Both the forward and backward processes are SDEs, though the forward process is integrable in closed-form, so it can be done at no computational cost. The backward process is not integrable in closed-form, so it must be integrated step-by-step by standard SDE solvers, which can be very expensive. The probability path in diffusions model is defined through an Itô process and one can retrieve the deterministic process by using the Probability ODE flow formulation. is to construct a probability path minimizing the Wasserstein metric. The distribution on which we condition is an approximation of the optimal transport plan between \pi_0  and \pi_1

: z = (x_0, x_1)  and q(z) = \Gamma(\pi_0, \pi_1) , where \Gamma is the optimal transport plan, which can be approximated by mini-batch optimal transport. If the batch size is not large, then the transport it computes can be very far from the true optimal transport.

Rectified flow

The idea of rectified flow is to learn a flow model such that the velocity is nearly constant along each flow path. This is beneficial, because we can integrate along such a vector field with very few steps. For example, if an ODE \dot{\phi_t}(x) = v_t(\phi_t(x)) follows perfectly straight paths, it simplifies to \phi_t(x) = x_0 + t \cdot v_0(x_0), allowing for exact solutions in one step. In practice, we cannot reach such perfection, but when the flow field is nearly so, we can take a few large steps instead of many little steps.

The general idea is to start with two distributions \pi_0 and \pi_1, then construct a flow field \phi^0 = \{\phi_t: t\in[0,1\} from it, then repeatedly apply a "reflow" operation to obtain successive flow fields \phi^1, \phi^2, \dots, each straighter than the previous one. When the flow field is straight enough for the application, we stop.

Generally, for any time-differentiable process \phi_t, v_t can be estimated by solving:

\min_{\theta} \int_0^1  \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_t}\left [\lVert{v_t(x, \theta) - v_t(x)}\rVert^2\right] \,\mathrm{d}t.

In rectified flow, by injecting strong priors that intermediate trajectories are straight, it can achieve both theoretical relevance for optimal transport  and computational efficiency, as ODEs with straight paths can be simulated precisely without time discretization.

to predict the mean and diagonal covariance of the noise, given the textual conditioning and the partially denoised image. It is the same as standard U-Net-based denoising diffusion model, with a Transformer replacing the U-Net. Mixture of experts-Transformer can also be applied.

DDPM can be used to model general data distributions, not just natural-looking images. For example, Human Motion Diffusion models human motion trajectory by DDPM. Each human motion trajectory is a sequence of poses, represented by either joint rotations or positions. It uses a Transformer network to generate a less noisy trajectory out of a noisy one.

Conditioning

The base diffusion model can only generate unconditionally from the whole distribution. For example, a diffusion model learned on ImageNet would generate images that look like a random image from ImageNet. To generate images from just one category, one would need to impose the condition, and then sample from the conditional distribution. Whatever condition one wants to impose, one needs to first convert the conditioning into a vector of floating point numbers, then feed it into the underlying diffusion model neural network. However, one has freedom in choosing how to convert the conditioning into a vector.

Stable Diffusion, for example, imposes conditioning in the form of cross-attention mechanism, where the query is an intermediate representation of the image in the U-Net, and both key and value are the conditioning vectors. The conditioning can be selectively applied to only parts of an image, and new kinds of conditionings can be finetuned upon the base model, as used in ControlNet.

As a particularly simple example, consider image inpainting. The conditions are \tilde x, the reference image, and m, the inpainting mask. The conditioning is imposed at each step of the backward diffusion process, by first sampling \tilde x_t \sim N\left(\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t} \tilde x, \sigma_{t}^2 I \right), a noisy version of \tilde x, then replacing x_t with (1-m) \odot x_t + m \odot \tilde x_t, where \odot means elementwise multiplication. Another application of cross-attention mechanism is prompt-to-prompt image editing.

Conditioning is not limited to just generating images from a specific category, or according to a specific caption (as in text-to-image). For example,

Upscaling

As generating an image takes a long time, one can try to generate a small image by a base diffusion model, then upscale it by other models. Upscaling can be done by GAN, Transformer, or signal processing methods like Lanczos resampling.

Diffusion models themselves can be used to perform upscaling. Cascading diffusion model stacks multiple diffusion models one after another, in the style of Progressive GAN. The lowest level is a standard diffusion model that generate 32x32 image, then the image would be upscaled by a diffusion model specifically trained for upscaling, and the process repeats. is a 3.5-billion diffusion model, and a small version was released publicly. Soon after, DALL-E 2 was released (2022-04). DALL-E 2 is a 3.5-billion cascaded diffusion model that generates images from text by "inverting the CLIP image encoder", the technique which they termed "unCLIP".

The unCLIP method contains 4 models: a CLIP image encoder, a CLIP text encoder, an image decoder, and a "prior" model (which can be a diffusion model, or an autoregressive model). During training, the prior model is trained to convert CLIP image encodings to CLIP text encodings. The image decoder is trained to convert CLIP image encodings back to images. During inference, a text is converted by the CLIP text encoder to a vector, then it is converted by the prior model to an image encoding, then it is converted by the image decoder to an image.

The denoising network is a U-Net, with cross-attention blocks to allow for conditional image generation. changed the latent diffusion model from the UNet to a Transformer model, and so it is a DiT. It uses rectified flow.

The first step denoises a white noise to a 64×64 image, conditional on the embedding vector of the text. This model has 2B parameters. The second step upscales the image by 64×64→256×256, conditional on embedding. This model has 650M parameters. The third step is similar, upscaling by 256×256→1024×1024. This model has 400M parameters. The three denoising networks are all U-Nets.
