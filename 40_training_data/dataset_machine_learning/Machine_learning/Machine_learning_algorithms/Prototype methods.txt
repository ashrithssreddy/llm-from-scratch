Prototype methods are machine learning methods that use data prototypes. A data prototype is a data value that reflects other values in its class, e.g., the centroid in a K-means clustering problem.

Methods

The following are some prototype methods

K-means clustering

Learning vector quantization (LVQ)

Gaussian mixtures

Related Methods

While K-nearest neighbor's does not use prototypes, it is similar to prototype methods like K-means clustering.
