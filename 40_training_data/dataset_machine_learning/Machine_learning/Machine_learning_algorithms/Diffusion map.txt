Diffusion maps is a dimensionality reduction or feature extraction algorithm introduced by Coifman and Lafon spectral clustering, low dimensional representation of images, image segmentation, and identification, image inpainting,  and so on.

Furthermore, the diffusion maps framework has been productively extended to complex networks, revealing a functional organisation of networks which differs from the purely topological or structural one.
