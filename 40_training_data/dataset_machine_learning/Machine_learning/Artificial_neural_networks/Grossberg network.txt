Grossberg network is an artificial neural network introduced by Stephen Grossberg. It is a self organizing, competitive network based on continuous time. Grossberg, a neuroscientist and a biomedical engineer, designed this network based on the human visual system.

Shunting model

The shunting model is one of Grossberg's neural network models, based on a Leaky integrator, described by the differential equation

{dn\over dt} \; = \; -An \; + (B - n)E \; - (C + n)I,

where n=n(t) represents the activation level of a neuron, E=E(t) and I=I(t) represent the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the neuron, and A, B, and C are constants representing the leaky decay rate and the maximum and minimum activation levels.

At equilibrium (where dn/dt=0), the activation n reaches the value

n \; = \; {BE-CI\over A+E+I}.
