Encog is a machine learning framework available for Java and .Net.

Encog supports different learning algorithms such as Bayesian Networks, Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines.

However, its main strength lies in its neural network algorithms. Encog contains classes to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process data for these neural networks. Encog trains using many different techniques.  Multithreading is used to allow optimal training performance on multicore machines.

Encog can be used for many tasks, including medical and financial research. A GUI based workbench is also provided to help model and train neural networks.  Encog has been in active development since 2008.
