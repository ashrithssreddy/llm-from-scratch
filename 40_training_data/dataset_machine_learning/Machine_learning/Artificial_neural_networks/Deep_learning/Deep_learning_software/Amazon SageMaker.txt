Amazon SageMaker AI is a cloud-based machine-learning platform that allows the creation, training, and deployment by developers of machine-learning (ML) models on the cloud. The platform was launched in November 2017. In addition, it offers a number of built-in ML algorithms that developers can train on their own data. AWS Batch for offline batch processing, or Amazon Kinesis for real-time processing.

Development interfaces

A number of interfaces are available for developers to interact with SageMaker. First, there is a web API that remotely controls a SageMaker server instance. While the web API is agnostic to the programming language used by the developer, Amazon provides SageMaker API bindings for a number of languages, including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, and Go. In addition, SageMaker provides managed Jupyter Notebook instances for interactively programming SageMaker and other applications.
