"1999" is a song by British singer Charli XCX and Australian singer Troye Sivan, released as the lead single from the former's third studio album Charli on 5 October 2018. The single cover was inspired by the 1999 film The Matrix.

A sequel to the track, "2099", was released as a promotional single in September 2019.

"1999" was playable in Just Dance Unlimited on Just Dance 2020 but was removed on August 1, 2024, due to licensing constraints.

Background and composition

Background

The song contains nostalgic lyrical references to the titular year along with a snare-heavy beat, "fuzzy sawtooth bass and sparking Eurodance keys". Sasha Geffen of Pitchfork stated that the track is "more concerned with the act of remembering than with the specifics of the year it calls up itself" and "fits alongside the rest of Charli XCX's sleek, forward-looking pop songs".

Musical composition

The song is written in the key of B minor, with an allegro tempo of 124 BPM in  common time. Sivan's and Charli XCX's voices span between the notes B3 and F#5.

Artwork

The cover art references the 1999 film The Matrix, with Sivan dressed as Neo, wearing dark sunglasses, a black overcoat, and dyed black hair against a bright green background. Charli XCX, who is dressed as Trinity, flanks him.

Promotion

Charli XCX and Sivan tweeted lyrics from "1999" addressed to each other on Twitter before sharing the cover art and title of the song.
