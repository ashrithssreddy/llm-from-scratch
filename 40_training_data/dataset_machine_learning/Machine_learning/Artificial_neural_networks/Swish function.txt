The swish function is a family of mathematical function defined as follows:

\operatorname{swish}_\beta(x) = x \operatorname{sigmoid}(\beta x) = \frac{x}{1+e^{-\beta x}}.. Variants of the swish function include Mish.

Special values

For β&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the function is linear: f(x) = x/2.

For β&nbsp;=&thinsp;1, the function is the Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU).

With β&nbsp;→&nbsp;∞, the function converges to ReLU.

Thus, the swish family smoothly interpolates between a linear function and the ReLU function.
