Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is a type of recurrent neural network. BAM was introduced by Bart Kosko in 1988. There are two types of associative memory, auto-associative and hetero-associative. BAM is hetero-associative, meaning given a pattern it can return another pattern which is potentially of a different size.  It is similar to the Hopfield network in that they are both forms of associative memory. However, Hopfield nets return patterns of the same size.

It is said to be bi-directional as it can respond to inputs from either the input or the output layer.

Topology

A BAM contains two layers of neurons, which we shall denote X and Y. Layers X and Y are fully connected to each other. Once the weights have been established, input into layer X presents the pattern in layer Y, and vice versa.

The layers can be connected in both directions (bidirectional) with the result the weight matrix sent from the X layer to the Y layer is W and the weight matrix for signals sent from the Y layer to the X layer is W^T. Thus, the weight matrix is calculated in both directions. (i.e. E(A,B) = -AMA^T).
