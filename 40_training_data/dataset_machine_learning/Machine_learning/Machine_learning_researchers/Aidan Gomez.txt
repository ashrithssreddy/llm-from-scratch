Career

In 2017, as a 20 year-old intern at Google Brain, Gomez was one of eight authors of the research paper "Attention Is All You Need", which is credited with changing the AI industry and helping lead to the creation of ChatGPT. The paper proposed a novel deep learning architecture called the transformer, that enables machine learning models to analyze large amounts of data for patterns, and then use those patterns to make predictions while leveraging GPU parallelization.  It has been commonly adopted for training large language models and in the development of generative AI.

As a PhD student, Gomez worked as a machine learning researcher at Google Brain. He is CEO of the company, which has been valued at $5.5 billion as of July 2024.
