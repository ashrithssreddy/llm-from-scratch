Deepti Gurdasani is a British-Indian clinical epidemiologist and statistical geneticist who is a senior lecturer in machine learning at the Queen Mary University of London.

Research and career

In 2013, Gurdasani joined the Wellcome Sanger Institute as a postdoctoral fellow, where she worked on the genomic diversity of African populations and how this diversity impacts susceptibility to disease. She makes use of dense genotypes and whole genome sequences to better understand how population movements determined genetic structure. In particular, Gurdasani develops machine learning algorithms to large-scale clinical data sets. At the Sanger Gurdasani co-led the African Genome Variation Project and the Uganda Resource Project. She has researched the incidence of long covid in the UK. In 2021 Gurdasani started to write for The Guardian.
