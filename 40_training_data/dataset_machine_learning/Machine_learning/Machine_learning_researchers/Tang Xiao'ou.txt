His editorial contributions include roles as an Associate Editor for both the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence and the International Journal of Computer Vision.

Biography

Tang was born in Anshan, Liaoning, northeastern China in 1968.

Tang received a Bachelor of Science with a major in computer science from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1990. He received a Master of Science from the University of Rochester in 1991 and a Doctor of Philosophy in ocean engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996. He worked at MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution during his doctoral studies. Funders of his research included the Office of Naval Research of the United States Department of the Navy.

After graduating from MIT, Tang taught in the Department of Information Engineering of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2001, he founded the Multimedia Laboratory of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. From 2005 to 2008, he worked at Microsoft Research Asia.
