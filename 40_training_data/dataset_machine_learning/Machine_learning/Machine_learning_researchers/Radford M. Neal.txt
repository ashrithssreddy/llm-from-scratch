Radford M. Neal (born September 12, 1956) is a professor emeritus at the Department of Statistics and Department of Computer Science  at the University of Toronto, where he held a Canada research chair in statistics and machine learning.

Education and career

Neal studied computer science at the University of Calgary, where he received his B.Sc. in 1977 and M.Sc. in 1980, with thesis work supervised by David Hill. He worked for several years as a sessional instructor at the University of Calgary and as a statistical consultant in the industry before coming back to the academia. Neal continued his study at the University of Toronto, where he received his Ph.D. in 1995 under the supervision of Geoffrey Hinton. Neal became an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in 1995, an associated professor in 1999 and a full professor since 2001. He was the Canada Research Chair in Statistics and Machine Learning from 2003 to 2016 and retired in 2017.

Neal has made great contributions in the area of machine learning and statistics, where he is particularly well known for his work on Markov chain Monte Carlo, error correcting codes and Bayesian learning for neural networks. He is also known for his blog and as the developer of pqR: a new version of the R interpreter.
