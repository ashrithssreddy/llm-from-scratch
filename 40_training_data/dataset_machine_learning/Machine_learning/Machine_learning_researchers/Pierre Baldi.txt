Pierre Baldi is a distinguished professor of computer science at University of California Irvine and the director of its Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics.

Education and early life

Born in Rome (Italy), Pierre Baldi received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees at the University of Paris, in France. He then obtained his Ph.D. degree in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology in 1986 supervised by R. M. Wilson. He was CEO of a start up company called Net-ID from 1995 to 1999 and joined University of California, Irvine in 1999.

Baldi's research is focused on understanding intelligence in brains and machines, through the study of the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and their applications to problems in the natural sciences, physics, chemistry, and biology.
