Education and career

White, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, graduated salutatorian from Southwest High School in 1968. He went on to study at Princeton University, receiving his B.A. in economics in 1972. He earned his Ph.D. in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1976, under the supervision of Jerry A. Hausman and Robert Solow. White spent his first years as an assistant professor in the University of Rochester before moving to University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1979. He remained at UCSD until his untimely death from cancer. A 1982 paper by White contributed strongly to the development of quasi-maximum likelihood estimation. He also contributed to numerous other areas such as neural networks and medicine. In 1999, White co-founded an economic consulting firm, Bates White, which is based in Washington, D.C.
