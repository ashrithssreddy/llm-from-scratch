Duygu Kuzum (born 1983) is a Turkish-American electrical engineer who is a professor at the University of California, San Diego's Jacobs School of Engineering. She develops transparent neural sensors based on single-layer materials. She was awarded a National Institutes of Health New Innovator Award in 2020. She became interested in science as a child. She attended Bilkent University and was a doctoral researcher at Stanford University. Her doctoral research considered MOSFETs for CMOS applications. During her doctorate, she completed an internship at Intel. In 2011, she joined the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral researcher, working in the Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics on the development of transparent neural electrodes. Her research focuses on innovative computation strategies based on neural networks. She has built self-assembled structures from stem cells embedded with controllable neural sensors to mimic the embryonic human brain.
