Rule induction is an area of machine learning in which formal rules are extracted from a set of observations.  The rules extracted may represent a full scientific model of the data, or merely represent local patterns in the data.

Data mining in general and rule induction in detail are trying to create algorithms without human programming but with analyzing existing data structures. In the easiest case, a rule is expressed with “if-then statements” and was created with the ID3 algorithm for decision tree learning.

Creating different algorithm and testing them with input data can be realized in the WEKA software.
