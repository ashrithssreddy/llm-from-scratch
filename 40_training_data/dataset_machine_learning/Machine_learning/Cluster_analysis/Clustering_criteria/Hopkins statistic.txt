The Hopkins statistic (introduced by Brian Hopkins and John Gordon Skellam) is a way of measuring the cluster tendency of a data set. It belongs to the family of sparse sampling tests. It acts as a statistical hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the data is generated by a Poisson point process and are thus uniformly randomly distributed. If individuals are aggregated, then its value approaches 1, and if they are randomly distributed along the value tends to 0.5.

Preliminaries

A typical formulation of the Hopkins statistic follows.

H=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}}{\sum_{i=1}^m{u_i^d}+\sum_{i=1}^m{w_i^d}} \,

Under the null hypotheses, this statistic has a Beta(m,m) distribution.
