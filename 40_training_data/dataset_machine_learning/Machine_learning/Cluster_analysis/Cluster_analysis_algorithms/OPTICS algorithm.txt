Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) is an algorithm for finding density-based clusters in spatial data. It was presented in 1999 by Mihael Ankerst, Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel and Jörg Sander.

Its basic idea is similar to DBSCAN, but it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses: the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density. To do so, the points of the database are (linearly) ordered such that spatially closest points become neighbors in the ordering. Additionally, a special distance is stored for each point that represents the density that must be accepted for a cluster so that both points belong to the same cluster. This is represented as a dendrogram.

Basic idea

Like DBSCAN, OPTICS requires two parameters: , which describes the maximum distance (radius) to consider, and , describing the number of points required to form a cluster. A point  is a core point if at least  points are found within its -neighborhood N_\varepsilon(p) (including point  itself). In contrast to DBSCAN, OPTICS also considers points that are part of a more densely packed cluster, so each point is assigned a core distance that describes the distance to the th closest point:

\text{core-dist}_\mathit{\varepsilon,MinPts}(p)=

\begin{cases}

\text{UNDEFINED} & \text{if } |N_\varepsilon(p)|

The reachability-distance of another point  from a point  is either the distance between  and , or the core distance of , whichever is bigger:

\text{reachability-dist}_\mathit{\varepsilon,MinPts}(o,p) =

\begin{cases}

\text{UNDEFINED} & \text{if } |N_\varepsilon(p)|

If  and  are nearest neighbors, this is the \varepsilon'  we need to assume to have  and  belong to the same cluster.

Both core-distance and reachability-distance are undefined if no sufficiently dense cluster (w.r.t. ) is available. Given a sufficiently large , this never happens, but then every -neighborhood query returns the entire database, resulting in O(n^2) runtime. Hence, the  parameter is required to cut off the density of clusters that are no longer interesting, and to speed up the algorithm.

The parameter  is, strictly speaking, not necessary. It can simply be set to the maximum possible value. When a spatial index is available, however, it does play a practical role with regards to complexity. OPTICS abstracts from DBSCAN by removing this parameter, at least to the extent of only having to give the maximum value.

Pseudocode

The basic approach of OPTICS is similar to DBSCAN, but instead of maintaining known, but so far unprocessed cluster members in a set, they are maintained in a priority queue (e.g. using an indexed heap).

function OPTICS(DB, ε, MinPts) is

for each point p of DB do

p.reachability-distance = UNDEFINED

for each unprocessed point p of DB do

N = getNeighbors(p, ε)

mark p as processed

output p to the ordered list

if core-distance(p, ε, MinPts) != UNDEFINED then

Seeds = empty priority queue

update(N, p, Seeds, ε, MinPts)

for each next q in Seeds do

N' = getNeighbors(q, ε)

mark q as processed

output q to the ordered list

if core-distance(q, ε, MinPts) != UNDEFINED do

update(N', q, Seeds, ε, MinPts)

In update(), the priority queue Seeds is updated with the \varepsilon-neighborhood of p and q, respectively:

function update(N, p, Seeds, ε, MinPts) is

coredist = core-distance(p, ε, MinPts)

for each o in N

if o is not processed then

new-reach-dist = max(coredist, dist(p,o))

if o.reachability-distance == UNDEFINED then // o is not in Seeds

o.reachability-distance = new-reach-dist

Seeds.insert(o, new-reach-dist)

else               // o in Seeds, check for improvement

if new-reach-dist \varepsilon and  parameters; here a value of 0.1 may yield good results), or by different algorithms that try to detect the valleys by steepness, knee detection, or local maxima. A range of the plot beginning with a steep descent and ending with a steep ascent is considered a valley, and corresponds to a contiguous area of high density. Additional care must be taken to the last points in a valley to assign them to the inner or outer cluster, this can be achieved by considering the predecessor. Clusterings obtained this way usually are hierarchical, and cannot be achieved by a single DBSCAN run.

Complexity

Like DBSCAN, OPTICS processes each point once, and performs one \varepsilon-neighborhood query during this processing. Given a spatial index that grants a neighborhood query in O(\log n) runtime, an overall runtime of O(n \cdot \log n) is obtained. The worst case however is O(n^2), as with DBSCAN. The authors of the original OPTICS paper report an actual constant slowdown factor of 1.6 compared to DBSCAN. Note that the value of \varepsilon might heavily influence the cost of the algorithm, since a value too large might raise the cost of a neighborhood query to linear complexity.

In particular, choosing \varepsilon > \max_{x,y} d(x,y) (larger than the maximum distance in the data set) is possible, but leads to quadratic complexity, since every neighborhood query returns the full data set. Even when no spatial index is available, this comes at additional cost in managing the heap. Therefore, \varepsilon should be chosen appropriately for the data set.

Extensions

OPTICS-OF is an outlier detection algorithm based on OPTICS. The main use is the extraction of outliers from an existing run of OPTICS at low cost compared to using a different outlier detection method. The better known version LOF is based on the same concepts.

DeLi-Clu, Density-Link-Clustering combines ideas from single-linkage clustering and OPTICS, eliminating the \varepsilon parameter and offering performance improvements over OPTICS.

HiSC is a hierarchical subspace clustering (axis-parallel) method based on OPTICS.

HiCO is a hierarchical correlation clustering algorithm based on OPTICS.

DiSH is an improvement over HiSC that can find more complex hierarchies.

FOPTICS is a faster implementation using random projections.

HDBSCAN* is based on a refinement of DBSCAN, excluding border-points from the clusters and thus following more strictly the basic definition of density-levels by Hartigan.

Availability

Java implementations of OPTICS, OPTICS-OF, DeLi-Clu, HiSC, HiCO and DiSH are available in the ELKI data mining framework (with index acceleration for several distance functions, and with automatic cluster extraction using the &xi; extraction method). Other Java implementations include the Weka extension (no support for &xi; cluster extraction).

The R package "dbscan" includes a C++ implementation of OPTICS (with both traditional dbscan-like and &xi; cluster extraction) using a k-d tree for index acceleration for Euclidean distance only.

Python implementations of OPTICS are available in the PyClustering library and in scikit-learn. HDBSCAN* is available in the hdbscan library.
