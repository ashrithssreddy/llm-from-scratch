Jais is an open-source large language model launched in August 2023. Developed as a collaboration between Emirati AI company G42, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), and US-based Cerebras Systems, Jais was designed to produce high-quality Arabic text and was also trained on English data.

The model's creation was motivated by the underrepresentation of the Arabic language in the field of generative artificial intelligence. It aims to provide a more culturally and linguistically accurate model for the world's 400 million Arabic speakers. Its name is a reference to Jebel Jais, the highest mountain in the UAE. The project represents a significant investment by the United Arab Emirates in the field of AI as part of its national strategy. Both models were trained on a subset of the Cerebras Condor Galaxy 1 supercomputer.

The training dataset consisted of a mix of Arabic, English, and computer code. According to Timothy Baldwin, a professor of natural language processing at MBZUAI, training the model on a diverse Arabic dataset allows it to switch between dialects.

Features

Jais is designed to generate text in both English and Arabic. The project has also released instruction-tuned "Chat" variants for both the 13B and 30B models, which are specifically optimized for conversational applications. Additional functionality for working with images, graphs, and tabular data is planned for future releases.
