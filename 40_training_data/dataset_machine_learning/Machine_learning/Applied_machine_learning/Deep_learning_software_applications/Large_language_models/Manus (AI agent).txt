Manus (meaning "hand" in Latin) is an autonomous artificial intelligence agent developed by Butterfly Effect Technology, a Singapore-based technology startup. The agent is designed to independently execute complex real-world tasks without continuous human supervision. Launched on March 6, 2025, Manus has been described as one of the first fully autonomous AI agents capable of independent reasoning, dynamic planning, and autonomous decision-making.

History

Company background

Butterfly Effect Technology was founded by entrepreneur Xiao Hong (), who previously established Nightingale Technology in 2015.

In 2022, recognizing the potential of large language models, Xiao Hong founded Butterfly Effect and released Monica, an AI assistant browser extension integrating models including ChatGPT and Claude.

In early 2024, ByteDance attempted to acquire Monica for US$30 million, but Xiao Hong declined to maintain independence. Monica closed a funding round in late 2024 at an estimated valuation of nearly $100 million. This investment subsequently came under review by the U.S. Treasury Department over compliance with 2023 restrictions on investing in Chinese AI companies.

The product launch featured a four-minute demonstration video showcasing Manus's capabilities. Over two million users joined the waitlist within the first week, causing server load issues and prompting implementation of an invite-only closed beta system. The system employs a multi-model approach, dynamically selecting models based on subtask requirements.

Transparent interface: The "Manus's Computer" feature provides visibility into execution processes, allowing users to review task completion steps through session replay. While the company states that it does not store personal information or task history, users and commentators have raised concerns about limited transparency in how Manus accesses, handles, and retains data.

Performance

GAIA benchmark

Manus achieved notable performance on the GAIA (General AI Assistant) benchmark, developed by Meta AI, Hugging Face, and the AutoGPT team to evaluate AI agents on real-world problem-solving.

Company-disclosed results:

The company claimed state-of-the-art performance across all three tiers, reportedly exceeding OpenAI's Deep Research system. Key capabilities include:

Research and analysis: Conducts comprehensive multi-source research on complex topics, synthesizing information into structured reports with citations.

Some experts expressed skepticism about claimed benchmark results. Kyle Wiggers of TechCrunch reported that Manus had trouble with seemingly simple tasks such as ordering a sandwich, booking a hotel room, or developing a game, noting it "didn't work quite as well as advertised." Users also reported error messages, endless loops, factual inaccuracies, and crashes during the early beta period.

Media coverage

Forbes described Manus as potentially changing the notion that the United States is the undisputed leader in AI development, suggesting China may have surpassed the U.S. in the race to fully autonomous AI systems. The platform was featured in Chinese state media broadcasts, signaling government support for the technology.

Comparison with competitors

Manus competes in the emerging autonomous AI agent market alongside:

OpenAI Deep Research – Research-focused agent integrated with ChatGPT

Google Project Astra – Multimodal AI assistant with agent capabilities

Anthropic Computer Use – Claude-based system for computer control

Microsoft Copilot Studio – Enterprise-focused automation platform

Devin – AI software engineer by Cognition AI

Manus differentiates through its consumer-focused approach, transparent execution interface, and multi-model architecture strategy. Unlike traditional chatbots that require step-by-step instructions, Manus is designed to start tasks independently and dynamically adjust its approach.

Controversies and concerns

Safety and control

AI safety researchers have raised concerns about autonomous agents operating with minimal human oversight. Questions include potential for unintended actions with real-world consequences, difficulty in predicting agent behavior in novel situations, challenges in establishing meaningful alignment with user intentions, and risk of agents accessing sensitive information inappropriately.

The company is aware of relatively high failure rates compared to systems like ChatGPT, with users reporting crashes and a tendency to get stuck in infinite feedback loops. Chief Scientist Ji Yichao acknowledged these as teething issues inherent in launching new autonomous agent technology.

Model transparency

Critics have noted limited transparency regarding which foundation models handle specific tasks and how the system routes requests. This raises questions about reproducibility of results, attribution of capabilities to specific models, verification of benchmark performance claims, and understanding of system limitations.

The company describes Manus as operating through "extreme repackaging" or "kitbashing" of existing large language models rather than developing proprietary models from scratch. Some industry observers question whether this approach represents genuine innovation or merely clever integration of existing technologies.

Regulatory scrutiny

Benchmark's $75 million investment in Manus came under review by the U.S. Treasury Department in May 2025 over compliance with 2023 executive order restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese AI companies. Benchmark's lawyers cleared the investment on grounds that Manus does not technically develop its own AI models and is incorporated in the Cayman Islands rather than mainland China. The investment attracted criticism from Founders Fund partner Delian Asparouhov.

Future development

Planned features

According to company statements, Butterfly Effect plans to expand Manus availability to additional regions and languages throughout 2025, with particular focus on markets including the United States, Japan, and the Middle East
