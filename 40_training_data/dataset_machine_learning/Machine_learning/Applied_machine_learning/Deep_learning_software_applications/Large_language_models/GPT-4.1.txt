GPT-4.1 is a large language model within OpenAI's GPT series. It was released on April 14, 2025. GPT-4.1 can be accessed through the OpenAI API or the OpenAI Developer Playground. Three different models were simultaneously released: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano. Since May 14, GPT-4.1 has been available for users subscribed to the ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans, and GPT-4.1 mini that replaces GPT-4o mini is available for all ChatGPT users.

Overview

All three models have a context window of 1 million tokens and a knowledge cutoff of June 2024. and "Graphwalks" (forcing the model to simulate breadth-first search). The models are also trained to follow instructions more literally, making the model more steerable. Zvi Mowshowitz described GPT-4.1-mini as an "excellent practical model". However, he criticized OpenAI for not doing enough safety testing, saying that he "hate[s] the precedent this sets".
