AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet, which performs predictions of protein structure. It is designed using deep learning techniques.

AlphaFold 1 (2018) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) in December 2018. It was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structures for targets rated as most difficult by the competition organizers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with partially similar sequences.

AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated this placement in the CASP14 competition in November 2020. It achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other entry. It scored above 90 on CASP's global distance test (GDT) for approximately two-thirds of the proteins, a test measuring the similarity between a computationally predicted structure and the experimentally determined structure, where 100 represents a complete match. The inclusion of metagenomic data has improved the quality of the prediction of multiple sequence alignments. One of the biggest sources of the training data was the custom-built Big Fantastic Database of 65,983,866 protein families, represented as multiple sequence alignments and Hidden Markov models, covering 2,204,359,010 protein sequences from reference databases, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes.

AlphaFold 2's results at CASP14 were described as "astounding"

Despite this, the technical achievement was widely recognized. On 15 July 2021, the AlphaFold 2 paper was published in Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes. As of November 2025, the paper had been cited nearly 43,000 times.

AlphaFold 3 was announced on 8 May 2024. It can predict the structure of complexes created by proteins with DNA, RNA, various ligands, and ions.

Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind shared one half of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded "for protein structure prediction," while the other half went to David Baker "for computational protein design." Hassabis and Jumper had previously won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences and the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 2023 for their leadership of the AlphaFold project. Such efforts, using the experimental methods, have identified the structures of about 170,000 proteins over the last 60 years, while there are over 200 million known proteins across all life forms.

force field. This step only slightly adjusts the predicted structure.

A key part of the 2020 system are two modules, believed to be based on a transformer design, which are used to progressively refine a vector of information for each relationship (or "edge" in graph-theory terminology) between an amino acid residue of the protein and another amino acid residue (these relationships are represented by the array shown in green); and between each amino acid position and each different sequences in the input sequence alignment (these relationships are represented by the array shown in red). and is itself then iterated. In an example presented by DeepMind, the structure prediction module achieved a correct topology for the target protein on its first iteration, scored as having a GDT_TS of 78, but with a large number (90%) of stereochemical violations – i.e. unphysical bond angles or lengths. With subsequent iterations the number of stereochemical violations fell. By the third iteration the GDT_TS of the prediction was approaching 90, and by the eighth iteration the number of stereochemical violations was approaching zero.

The training data was originally restricted to single peptide chains. However, the October 2021 update, named AlphaFold-Multimer, included protein complexes in its training data. DeepMind stated this update succeeded about 70% of the time at accurately predicting protein-protein interactions.

AlphaFold 3 (2024)

Announced on 8 May 2024, AlphaFold 3 was co-developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs, both subsidiaries of Alphabet. AlphaFold 3 is not limited to single-chain proteins, as it can also predict the structures of protein complexes with DNA, RNA, post-translational modifications and selected ligands and ions. The Pairformer module's initial predictions are refined by a diffusion model. This model begins with a cloud of atoms and iteratively refines their positions, guided by the Pairformer's output, to generate a 3D representation of the molecular structure. As of November 2025, the AlphaFold 3 research paper has been directly cited more than 9,000 times.

The orange trend-line shows that by 2020 online prediction servers had been able to learn from and match this performance, while the best other groups (green curve) had on average been able to make some improvements on it. However, the black trend curve shows the degree to which AlphaFold 2 had surpassed this again in 2020, across the board. The detailed spread of data points indicates the degree of consistency or variation achieved by AlphaFold.

CASP13

In December 2018, DeepMind's AlphaFold placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP). achieving a median score of 58.9 on the CASP's global distance test (GDT) score, ahead of 52.5 and 52.4 by the two next best-placed teams, who were also using deep learning to estimate contact distances. Overall, across all targets, AlphaFold 1 achieved a GDT score of 68.5.

In January 2020, implementations and illustrative code of AlphaFold 1 was released open-source on GitHub. Overall, AlphaFold 2 made the best prediction for 88 out of the 97 targets. a level of accuracy reported to be comparable to experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography. with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of 2.1 Å for a set of overlapped CA atoms.

Reception

AlphaFold 2 scoring more than 90 in CASP's global distance test (GDT) is a great achievement in computational biology. News pieces appeared in the science press, such as Nature, and the story was covered by national newspapers. A frequent theme was the ability to predict protein structures based on the constituent amino acid sequence, expected to have benefits in the life sciences—accelerating drug discovery and enabling better understanding of diseases. Some have noted that even a perfect answer to the protein prediction problem still leaves questions about the protein folding problem (and thus protein dynamics)—understanding in detail how the folding process actually occurs in nature (and how sometimes they can also misfold).

In 2023, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences as well as the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their management of the AlphaFold project. Hassabis and Jumper proceeded to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 for their work on "protein structure prediction" with David Baker of the University of Washington.

Source code

Open access to source code of several AlphaFold versions (excluding AlphaFold 3) has been provided by DeepMind after requests from the scientific community. The source code of AlphaFold 3 was made available for non-commercial use to the scientific community upon request in November 2024.

Database of protein models generated by AlphaFold

The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, a joint project between AlphaFold and EMBL-EBI, was launched on July 22, 2021. At launch, the database contained AlphaFold-predicted models for nearly the complete UniProt proteome of humans and 20 model organisms, totaling over 365,000 proteins. The database does not include proteins with fewer than 16 or more than 2700 amino acid residues, but for humans they are available in the whole batch file. AlphaFold's initial goal (as of early 2022) was to expand the database to cover most of the UniRef90 set, which contains over 100 million proteins. As of May 15, 2022, the database contained 992,316 predictions.

In July 2021, UniProt-KB and InterPro has been updated to show AlphaFold predictions when available.

On July 28, 2022, the team uploaded to the database the structures of around 200 million proteins from 1 million species, covering nearly every known protein on the planet.

Performance, validations and limitations

Despite its impressive success, AlphaFold has also shown certain limitations:

AlphaFold DB provides models of individual protein chains (monomers), rather than their biologically relevant complexes.

Many protein regions are predicted with low confidence score, including the intrinsically disordered protein regions.

Alphafold-2 was validated for predicting effects of point mutations on structure and free energy, with a partial success.

The model relies, to some extent, on co-evolutionary information from similar proteins. Therefore, it may not perform as well on synthetic proteins or proteins with very low homology to those in the training database.

The model's ability to predict multiple native conformations of proteins is limited.

Proteins are inherently dynamic, and accessing multiple native conformations is often crucial for understanding their function. However, the model has limited capability to represent these alternative conformational states, particularly those that coexist or interconvert in biological environments.

Across several benchmarks, AlphaFold3 has demonstrated, on average, superior performance to conventional search-based docking algorithms in predicting small-molecule–protein binding modes.

AlphaFold 3 version can predict structures of protein complexes with a very limited set of selected cofactors and co- and post-translational modifications. Between 50% and 70% of the structures of the human proteome are incomplete without covalently-attached glycans.

Studies have shown that although AlphaFold3 can jointly model protein–ligand co-folding, its accuracy drops markedly on test cases with low similarity to its training data—an area of particular importance for drug discovery. Other work has found that AlphaFold is insensitive to adversarial decoys generated by altering the physicochemical properties of binding pockets, suggesting potential reliance on training-set memorization rather than genuine chemical awareness.

In the algorithm, the residues are moved freely, without any restraints. Therefore, during modeling the integrity of the chain is not maintained. As a result, AlphaFold may produce topologically wrong results, like structures with an arbitrary number of knots.

Applications

AlphaFold has been used to predict structures of proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. The structures of these proteins were pending experimental detection in early 2020. The team acknowledged that although these protein structures might not be the subject of ongoing therapeutical research efforts, they will add to the community's understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
