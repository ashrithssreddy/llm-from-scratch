CatBoost is an open-source software library developed by Yandex. It provides a gradient boosting framework which, among other features, attempts to solve for categorical features using a permutation-driven alternative to the classical algorithm. It works on Linux, Windows, macOS, and is available in

Python,

R, and models built using CatBoost can be used for predictions in C++, Java, C#, Rust, Core ML, ONNX, and PMML. The source code is licensed under Apache License and available on GitHub.

InfoWorld magazine awarded the library "The best machine learning tools" in 2017. along with TensorFlow, Pytorch, XGBoost and 8 other libraries.

Kaggle listed CatBoost as one of the most frequently used machine learning (ML) frameworks in the world. It was listed as the top-8 most frequently used ML framework in the 2020 survey and as the top-7 most frequently used ML framework in the 2021 survey.

As of April 2022, CatBoost is installed about 100000 times per day from PyPI repository

Features

CatBoost has gained popularity compared to other gradient boosting algorithms primarily due to the following features

Native handling for categorical features

Fast GPU training

Visualizations and tools for model and feature analysis

Using oblivious trees or symmetric trees for faster execution

Ordered boosting to overcome overfitting

Cloudflare uses CatBoost for bot detection

Careem uses CatBoost to predict future destinations of the rides
