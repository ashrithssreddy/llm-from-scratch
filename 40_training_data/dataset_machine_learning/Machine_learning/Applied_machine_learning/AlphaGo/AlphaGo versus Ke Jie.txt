AlphaGo versus Ke Jie was a three-game Go match between the computer Go program AlphaGo Master and current world No. 1 ranking player Ke Jie, being part of the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China, played on 23, 25, and 27 May 2017. AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie in all three games.

Background

At the time of the match Ke Jie was ranked 1st among all human players worldwide under Rémi Coulom's ranking system, and had held that position since late 2014. Ke Jie was also ranked number one in the world under  Korea Baduk Association's, Japan Go Association's and Chinese Weiqi Association's ranking systems.

The version of AlphaGo in this match was AlphaGo Master, the one that defeated top pros in 60 online games, using four TPUs on a single machine with Elo rating 4,858. DeepMind claimed that this version was 3-stone stronger than the version used in AlphaGo v. Lee Sedol. AlphaGo Master was actually the second best version that DeepMind had at the time, for it was already in possession of AlphaGo Zero, a version much stronger than the Master version; this can be known by the fact that Nature received their paper on AlphaGo Zero on April 7, before the games with Ke Jie.
