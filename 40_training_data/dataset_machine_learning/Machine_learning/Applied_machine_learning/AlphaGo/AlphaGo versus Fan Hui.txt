Responses

AlphaGo's victory shocked the Go community. Lee Sedol commented that AlphaGo reached the top of the amateur level in this match, but had not yet reached the professional level, and he could give AlphaGo one or two stones. Ke Jie and Mi Yuting thought that the strength of AlphaGo in this match was equal to that of a candidate for Go professional, and extremely close to the professional level, while Shi Yue thought that it already reached the professional level.

Canadian AI specialist Jonathan Schaeffer, comparing AlphaGo with a "child prodigy" that lacked experience, considered this match "not yet a Deep Blue moment", and said that the real achievement would be "when the program plays a player in the true top echelon".
