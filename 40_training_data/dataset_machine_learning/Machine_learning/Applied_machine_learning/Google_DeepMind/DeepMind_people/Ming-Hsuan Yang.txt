Yang's work is focused on computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

Education and career

Yang received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Yang worked as a senior research scientist at the Honda Research Institute in Mountain View, California. He previously chaired the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) and the Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV).

Research

Much of Yang's research has explored intelligent systems such as AI, machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. In a paper published in 2013, Yang assessed online object tracking algorithms through large-scale experiments, identifying methods, benchmarking performance, and highlighting key factors influencing tracking accuracy across different scenarios. He also presented a graph-based manifold ranking approach for saliency detection, integrating foreground and background cues, and benchmark dataset evaluation.

Yang has been named a highly cited researcher from 2018 to 2024.
