name = Danielle Belgrave

fields = StatisticsMachine learning She studied mathematics and statistics at the London School of Economics (LSE). She was a graduate student at University College London (UCL), where she earned a master's degree in statistics.

Research and career

After graduating, Belgrave worked at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), where she was awarded the Exceptional Scientist Award. Statistical learning methods can inform the management of medical conditions by providing a framework for endotype discovery using probabilistic modelling. She uses statistical models to identify the underlying endotypes of a condition from a set of phenotypes.

She studied whether atopic march, the progression of allergic diseases from early life, adequately describes atopic diseases like eczema in early life. Belgrave used a latent disease profile model to study atopic march in over 9,000 children, where machine learning was used to identify groups of children with similar eczema onset patterns. Belgrave is interested in using big data for meaningful clinical interpretation, to inform personalized prevention strategies. In particular, Belgrave is interested in what scheme of liability should be imposed on artificial intelligence for healthcare., 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2025. She was General Chair of NeurIPS 2025 and is a member of the NeurIPS Board.
