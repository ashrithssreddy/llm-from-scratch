Jabberwacky is a chatbot created by British programmer Rollo Carpenter and launched in 1997. Its stated aim is to "simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner". It is an early attempt at creating an artificially intelligent chatbot through human interaction.

Purpose

The stated purpose of the project is to create an artificial intelligence that is capable of passing the Turing Test. It is designed to mimic human interaction and to carry out conversations with users. It is not designed to carry out any other functions. While Cleverbot.com continued to work in 2023, the Jabberwacky's website, tagged as "legacy only," stopped working temporarily from December 31, 2022 until approximately June 1, 2023, experienced a restoration for a little more than two weeks and then stopped working again.
