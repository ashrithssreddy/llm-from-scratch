AlphaDev is an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind to discover enhanced computer science algorithms using reinforcement learning. AlphaDev is based on AlphaZero, a system that mastered the games of chess, shogi and go by self-play. AlphaDev applies the same approach to finding faster algorithms for fundamental tasks such as sorting and hashing.

Development

On June 7, 2023, Google DeepMind published a paper in Nature introducing AlphaDev, which discovered new algorithms that outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for small sort algorithms. Upon analysing the algorithms in-depth, AlphaDev discovered two unique sequences of assembly instructions called the AlphaDev swap and copy moves that avoid a single assembly instruction each time they are applied. This was the first change to the C++ Standard Library sorting algorithms in more than a decade and the first update to involve an algorithm discovered using AI.

Design

AlphaDev is built on top of AlphaZero, the reinforcement-learning model that DeepMind trained to master games such as Go and chess.

LLVM standard sorting library

AlphaDev discovered new sorting algorithms, which led to up to 70% improvements in the LLVM libc++ sorting library for shorter sequences and about 1.7% improvements for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. These improvements apply to the uint32, uint64 and float data types for ARMv8, Intel Skylake and AMD Zen 2 CPU architectures. AlphaDev's branchless conditional assembly and new swap move contributed to these performance improvements. The discovered algorithms were reverse-engineered from low-level assembly to C++, and have officially been included in the libc++ standard sorting library. outperforming the human benchmark for single valued inputs by approximately three times in terms of speed. AlphaDev also discovered a new VarInt assignment move, combining two operations into a single instruction for latency savings.

Comparison with logical AI approach

The AlphaDev's performance was compared to stochastic superoptimization, a logical AI approach. The latter was run with at least the same amount of resources and wall-clock time as AlphaDev. The results showed that AlphaDev-S requires a prohibitive amount of time to optimize directly for latency, as latency needs to be computed after every mutation. As such, AlphaDev-S optimizes for a latency proxy, specifically algorithm length, and, then, at the end of training, all correct programs generated by AlphaDev-S are searched through.
