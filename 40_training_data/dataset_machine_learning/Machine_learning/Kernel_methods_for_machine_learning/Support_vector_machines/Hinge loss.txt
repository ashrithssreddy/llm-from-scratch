In machine learning, the hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers. The hinge loss is used for "maximum-margin" classification, most notably for support vector machines (SVMs).

For an intended output {{math|t  ±1}} and a classifier score , the hinge loss of the prediction  is defined as

\ell(y) = \max(0, 1-t \cdot y)

Note that y should be the "raw" output of the classifier's decision function, not the predicted class label. For instance, in linear SVMs, y = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b, where (\mathbf{w},b) are the parameters of the hyperplane and \mathbf{x} is the input variable(s).

When  and  have the same sign (meaning  predicts the right class) and |y| \ge 1, the hinge loss \ell(y) = 0. When they have opposite signs, \ell(y) increases linearly with , and similarly if |y| , even if it has the same sign (correct prediction, but not by enough margin).

The Hinge loss is not a proper scoring rule.

Extensions

While binary SVMs are commonly extended to multiclass classification in a one-vs.-all or one-vs.-one fashion,

it is also possible to extend the hinge loss itself for such an end. Several different variations of multiclass hinge loss have been proposed. For example, Crammer and Singer

defined it for a linear classifier as

\ell(y) = \max(0, 1 + \max_{y \ne t} \mathbf{w}_y \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{w}_t \mathbf{x}),

where t is the target label, \mathbf{w}_t and \mathbf{w}_y are the model parameters.

Weston and Watkins provided a similar definition, but with a sum rather than a max:

\ell(y) = \begin{cases}

\frac{1}{2} - ty       & \text{if} ~~ ty \le 0, \\

\frac{1}{2} (1 - ty)^2 & \text{if} ~~ 0

or the quadratically smoothed

\ell_\gamma(y) = \begin{cases}

\frac{1}{2\gamma} \max(0, 1 - ty)^2 & \text{if} ~~ ty \ge 1 - \gamma, \\

1 - \frac{\gamma}{2} - ty           & \text{otherwise}

\end{cases}

suggested by Zhang. The modified Huber loss L is a special case of this loss function with \gamma = 2, specifically L(t,y) = 4 \ell_2(y).
