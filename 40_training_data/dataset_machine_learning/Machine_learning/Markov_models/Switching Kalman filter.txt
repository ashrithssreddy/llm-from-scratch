The switching Kalman filtering (SKF) method is a variant of the Kalman filter. In its generalised form, it is often attributed to Kevin P. Murphy, but related switching state-space models have been in use.

Applications

Applications of the switching Kalman filter include: Brain–computer interfaces and neural decoding, real-time decoding for continuous neural-prosthetic control, and sensorimotor learning in humans.

It also has application in econometrics, For example, when an industrial plant has "multiple discrete modes of behaviour, each of which having a linear (Gaussian) dynamics".

Model

There are several variants of SKF discussed in.

The filtering and smoothing procedure for general cases is discussed in.
