In statistics, a hidden Markov random field is a generalization of a hidden Markov model.  Instead of having an underlying Markov chain, hidden Markov random fields have an  underlying Markov random field.

Suppose that we observe a random variable  Y_i , where  i \in S . Hidden Markov random fields assume that the probabilistic nature of  Y_i  is determined by the unobservable Markov random field  X_i ,  i \in S .

That is, given the neighbors  N_i  of  X_i, X_i  is independent of all other  X_j  (Markov property).

The main difference with a hidden Markov model is that neighborhood is not defined in 1 dimension but within a network, i.e.  X_i  is allowed to have more than the two neighbors that it would have in a Markov chain. The model is formulated in such a way that given  X_i ,  Y_i  are independent (conditional independence of the observable variables given the Markov random field).

In the vast majority of the related literature, the number of possible latent states is considered a user-defined constant. However, ideas from nonparametric Bayesian statistics, which allow for data-driven inference of the number of states, have been also recently investigated with success, e.g.
