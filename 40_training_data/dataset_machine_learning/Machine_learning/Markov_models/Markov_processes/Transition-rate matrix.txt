In probability theory, a transition-rate matrix (also known as a Q-matrix, intensity matrix, or infinitesimal generator matrix) is an array of numbers describing the instantaneous rate at which a continuous-time Markov chain transitions between states.

In a transition-rate matrix Q (sometimes written A), element q_{ij} (for i \neq j) denotes the rate departing from i and arriving in state j. The rates q_{ij} \geq 0, and the diagonal elements q_{ii} are defined such that

q_{ii} = -\sum_{j\neq i} q_{ij},

and therefore the rows of the matrix sum to zero.

Up to a global sign, a large class of examples of such matrices is provided by the Laplacian of a directed, weighted graph. The vertices of the graph correspond to the Markov chain's states.

Properties

The transition-rate matrix has following properties:

There is at least one eigenvector with a vanishing eigenvalue, exactly one if the graph of Q is strongly connected.

All other eigenvalues \lambda fulfill  0 > \mathrm{Re}\{\lambda\} \geq 2 \min_i q_{ii}.

All eigenvectors v with a non-zero eigenvalue fulfill \sum_{i}v_{i} = 0.

The Transition-rate matrix satisfies the relation Q=P'(0) where P(t) is the continuous stochastic matrix.

Example

An M/M/1 queue, a model which counts the number of jobs in a queueing system with arrivals at rate λ and services at rate μ, has transition-rate matrix

Q=\begin{pmatrix}

-\lambda & \lambda \\

\mu & -(\mu+\lambda) & \lambda \\

&\mu & -(\mu+\lambda) & \lambda \\

&&\mu & -(\mu+\lambda) & \ddots &\\

&&&\ddots&\ddots

\end{pmatrix}.
