In probability theory, uniformization method, (also known as Jensen's method) is a method to compute transient solutions of finite state continuous-time Markov chains, by approximating the process by a discrete-time Markov chain.

Method description

For a continuous-time Markov chain with transition rate matrix Q, the uniformized discrete-time Markov chain has probability transition matrix P:=(p_{ij})_{i,j}, which is defined by

p_{ij} = \begin{cases} q_{ij}/\gamma &\text{ if } i \neq j \\ 1 - \sum_{k \neq i} q_{ik}/\gamma &\text{ if } i=j \end{cases}

with γ, the uniform rate parameter, chosen such that

\gamma \geq \max_i |q_{ii}|.

In matrix notation:

P=I+\frac{1}{\gamma}Q.

For a starting distribution (0), the distribution at time t, (t) is computed by Using a parallel version of the algorithm, chains with state spaces of larger than 107 have been analysed.

Limitations

Reibman and Trivedi state that "uniformization is the method of choice for typical problems," though they note that for stiff problems some tailored algorithms are likely to perform better.
