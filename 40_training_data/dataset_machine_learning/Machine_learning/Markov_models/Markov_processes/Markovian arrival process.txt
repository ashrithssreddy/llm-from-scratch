In queueing theory, a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability, a Markovian arrival process (MAP or MArP) is a mathematical model for the time between job arrivals to a system. The simplest such process is a Poisson process where the time between each arrival is exponentially distributed.

The processes were first suggested by Marcel F. Neuts in 1979.

Definition

A Markov arrival process is defined by two matrices, D0 and D1 where elements of D0 represent hidden transitions and elements of D1 observable transitions. The block matrix Q below is a transition rate matrix for a continuous-time Markov chain.

Q=\left[\begin{matrix}

D_{0}&D_{1}&0&0&\dots\\

0&D_{0}&D_{1}&0&\dots\\

0&0&D_{0}&D_{1}&\dots\\

\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots

\end{matrix}\right]\; .

The simplest example is a Poisson process where D0&nbsp;=&nbsp;−λ and D1&nbsp;=&nbsp;λ where there is only one possible transition, it is observable, and occurs at rate λ. For Q to be a valid transition rate matrix, the following restrictions apply to the Di

\begin{align}

0\leq [D_{1}]_{i,j}&

Special cases

Phase-type renewal process

The phase-type renewal process is a Markov arrival process with phase-type distributed sojourn between arrivals. For example, if an arrival process has an interarrival time distribution PH(\boldsymbol{\alpha},S) with an exit vector denoted \boldsymbol{S}^{0}=-S\boldsymbol{1}, the arrival process has generator matrix,

Q=\left[\begin{matrix}

S&\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\boldsymbol{\alpha}&0&0&\dots\\

0&S&\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\boldsymbol{\alpha}&0&\dots\\

0&0&S&\boldsymbol{S}^{0}\boldsymbol{\alpha}&\dots\\

\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots\\

\end{matrix}\right]

Generalizations

Batch Markov arrival process

The batch Markovian arrival process (BMAP) is a generalisation of the Markovian arrival process by allowing more than one arrival at a time. The homogeneous case has rate matrix,

Q=\left[\begin{matrix}

D_{0}&D_{1}&D_{2}&D_{3}&\dots\\

0&D_{0}&D_{1}&D_{2}&\dots\\

0&0&D_{0}&D_{1}&\dots\\

\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots

\end{matrix}\right]\; .

An arrival of size k occurs every time a transition occurs in the sub-matrix D_{k}. Sub-matrices D_{k} have elements of \lambda_{i,j}, the rate of a Poisson process, such that,

0\leq [D_{k}]_{i,j}

0\leq [D_{0}]_{i,j}

[D_{0}]_{i,i}

and

\sum^{\infty}_{k=0}D_{k}\boldsymbol{1}=\boldsymbol{0}

Markov-modulated Poisson process

The Markov-modulated Poisson process or MMPP where m Poisson processes are switched between by an underlying continuous-time Markov chain. If each of the m Poisson processes has rate λi and the modulating continuous-time Markov has  m&nbsp;×&nbsp;m transition rate matrix R, then the MAP representation is

\begin{align}

D_{1} &= \operatorname{diag}\{\lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{m}\}\\

D_{0} &=R-D_1.

\end{align}

Fitting

A MAP can be fitted using an expectation–maximization algorithm.
