Uniform convergence in probability is a form of convergence in probability in statistical asymptotic theory and probability theory. It means that, under certain conditions, the empirical frequencies of all events in a certain event-family converge to their theoretical probabilities.  Uniform convergence in probability has applications to statistics as well as machine learning as part of statistical learning theory.

The law of large numbers says that, for each single event A, its empirical frequency in a sequence of independent trials converges (with high probability) to its theoretical probability. In many application however, the need arises to judge simultaneously the probabilities of events of an entire class S from one and the same sample. Moreover it, is required that the relative frequency of the events converge to the probability uniformly over the entire class of events S

Here "simple" means that the Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension of the class H is small relative to the size of the sample. In other words, a sufficiently simple collection of functions behaves roughly the same on a small random sample as it does on the distribution as a whole.

The Uniform Convergence Theorem was first proved by Vapnik and Chervonenkis using the concept of growth function.

Uniform convergence theorem

The statement of the uniform convergence theorem is as follows:

If H is a set of \{0,1\}-valued functions defined on a set X and  P is a probability distribution on X then for \varepsilon>0 and m a positive integer, we have:

P^m\\sum_{\sigma\in\Gamma_m} \int_{X^{2m}} 1_R(\sigma(x)) \, dP^{2m}(x) \\[5pt]

= {} & \int_{X^{2m}} \frac 1 \sum_{\sigma\in\Gamma_m} 1_R (\sigma(x)) \, dP^{2m}(x) \\[5pt]

& \text{(because } |\Gamma_{m}| \text{ is finite)} \\[5pt]

= {} & \int_{X^{2m}} \Pr[\sigma(x)\in R] \, dP^{2m}(x) \quad \text{(the expectation)} \\[5pt]

\leq {} & \max_{x\in X^{2m}}(\Pr[\sigma(x)\in R]).

\end{align}

The maximum is guaranteed to exist since there is only a finite set of values that probability under a random permutation can take.

Reduction to a finite class

Lemma: Basing on the previous lemma,

\max_{x\in X^{2m}}(\Pr[\sigma(x)\in R])\leq 4\Pi_H(2m)e^{-\varepsilon^2 m/8} .

Proof:

Let us define x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{2m}) and t=|H|_x| which is at most \Pi_H(2m). This means there are functions h_1,h_2,\ldots,h_t\in H such that for any h\in H,\exists i between 1 and t with h_i(x_k)=h(x_k) for 1\leq k\leq 2m.

We see that \sigma(x)\in R iff for some h in H satisfies,

\frac{1}{m}|\{1\leq i\leq m:h(x_{\sigma_{i}})=1\}|-\frac{1}{m}|\{m+1\leq i\leq 2m:h(x_{\sigma_{i}})=1\}||\geq\frac{\varepsilon}{2}.

Hence if we define w^{j}_{i}=1 if h_{j}(x_{i})=1 and w^{j}_{i}=0 otherwise.

For 1\leq i\leq m and 1\leq j\leq t, we have that \sigma(x)\in R iff for some j in {1,\ldots,t} satisfies |\frac 1 m \left(\sum_i w^j_{\sigma(i)}-\sum_i w^j_{\sigma(m+i)}\right)|\geq\frac \varepsilon 2 . By union bound we get

\Pr[\sigma(x)\in R]\leq t\cdot \max\left(\Pr[|\frac 1 m \left(\sum_i w^j_{\sigma_i} - \sum_i w^j_{\sigma_{m+i}}\right)| \geq \frac \varepsilon 2]\right)

\leq \Pi_{H}(2m)\cdot \max\left(\Pr\left[ \left| \frac 1 m \left(\sum_i w^j_{\sigma_i}-\sum_i w^j_{\sigma_{m+i}}\right)\right| \geq \frac \varepsilon 2 \right] \right).

Since, the distribution over the permutations \sigma is uniform for each i, so w^j_{\sigma_i}-w^j_{\sigma_{m+i}} equals \pm |w^j_i-w^j_{m+i}|, with equal probability.

Thus,

\Pr\left[\left|\frac 1 m \left(\sum_i \left(w^j_{\sigma_i}-w^j_{\sigma_{m+i}}\right)\right)\right|\geq\frac \varepsilon 2\right] = \Pr\left[ \left| \frac 1 m \left( \sum_i|w^j_i-w^j_{m+i}|\beta_i\right)\right|\geq\frac \varepsilon 2\right],

where the probability on the right is over \beta_{i} and both the possibilities are equally likely. By Hoeffding's inequality, this is at most 2e^{-m\varepsilon^2/8}.

Finally, combining all the three parts of the proof we get the Uniform Convergence Theorem.
