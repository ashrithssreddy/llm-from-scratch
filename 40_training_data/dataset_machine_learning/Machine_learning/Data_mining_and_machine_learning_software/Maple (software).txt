Maple is a symbolic and numeric computing environment as well as a multi-paradigm programming language. It covers several areas of technical computing, such as symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, data processing, visualization, and others. A toolbox, MapleSim, adds functionality for multidomain physical modeling and code generation.

Maple's capacity for symbolic computing include those of a general-purpose computer algebra system. For instance, it can manipulate mathematical expressions and find symbolic solutions to

certain problems, such as those arising from ordinary and partial differential equations.

Maple is developed commercially by the Canadian software company Maplesoft. The name 'Maple' is a reference to the software's Canadian heritage.

Overview

Core functionality

Users can enter mathematics in traditional mathematical notation.  Custom user interfaces can also be created. There is support for numeric computations, to arbitrary precision, as well as symbolic computation and visualization.  Examples of symbolic computations are given below.

Maple incorporates a dynamically typed imperative-style programming language (resembling Pascal), which permits variables of lexical scope. There are also interfaces to other languages (C, C#, Fortran, Java, MATLAB, and Visual Basic), as well as to Microsoft Excel.

Maple supports MathML 2.0, which is a W3C format for representing and interpreting mathematical expressions, including their display in web pages. There is also functionality for converting expressions from traditional mathematical notation to markup suitable for the typesetting system LaTeX.

Architecture

Maple is based on a small kernel, written in C, which provides the Maple language. Most functionality is provided by libraries, which come from a variety of sources. Most of the libraries are written in the Maple language; these have viewable source code.  Many numerical computations are performed by the NAG Numerical Libraries, ATLAS libraries, or GMP libraries.

Different functionality in Maple requires numerical data in different formats. Symbolic expressions are stored in memory as directed acyclic graphs. The standard interface and calculator interface are written in Java.

History

The first concept of Maple arose from a meeting in late 1980 at the University of Waterloo. Researchers at the university wished to purchase a computer powerful enough to run the Lisp-based computer algebra system Macsyma. Instead, they opted to develop their own computer algebra system, named Maple, that would run on lower cost computers. Aiming for portability, they began writing Maple in programming languages from the BCPL family (initially using a subset of B and C, and later on only C). By the end of 1983, over 50 universities had copies of Maple installed on their machines.

In 1984, the research group arranged with Watcom Products Inc to license and distribute the first commercially available version, Maple 3.3.).

In 1989, the first graphical user interface for Maple was developed and included with version 4.3 for the Macintosh. X11 and Windows versions of the new interface followed in 1990 with Maple V. In 1992, Maple V Release 2 introduced the Maple "worksheet" that combined text, graphics, and input and typeset output. In 1994 a special issue of a newsletter created by Maple developers called MapleTech was published.

In 1999, with the release of Maple 6, Maple included some of the NAG Numerical Libraries.  In 2003, the current "standard" interface was introduced with Maple 9. This interface is primarily written in Java (although portions, such as the rules for typesetting mathematical formulae, are written in the Maple language). The Java interface was criticized for being slow; improvements have been made in later versions, although the Maple&nbsp;11 documentation recommends the previous ("classic") interface for users with less than 500&nbsp;MB of physical memory.

Between 1995 and 2005 Maple lost significant market share to competitors due to a weaker user interface. With Maple 10 in 2005, Maple introduced a new "document mode" interface, which has since been further developed across several releases.

In September 2009 Maple and Maplesoft were acquired by the Japanese software retailer Cybernet Systems.

Examples of Maple code

The following code, which computes the factorial of a nonnegative integer, is an example of an imperative programming construct within Maple:

myfac := proc(n::nonnegint)

local out, i;

out := 1;

for i from 2 to n do

out := out * i

end do;

out

end proc;

Simple functions can also be defined using the "maps to" arrow notation:

myfac := n -> product(i, i = 1..n);

Find

\int\cos\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)dx.

int(cos(x/a), x);

Output:

a \sin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)

Determinant

Compute the determinant of a matrix.

M := Matrix([[1,2,3], [a,b,c], [x,y,z]]);  # example Matrix

\begin{bmatrix}

a & b & c \\

x & y & z

\end{bmatrix}

Solve equations numerically

The following code numerically calculates the roots of a high-order polynomial:

fsolve(f)

The same command can also solve systems of equations:

f := (cos(x+y))^2 + exp(x)*y+cot(x-y)+cosh(z+x) = 0:

g := x^5 - 8*y = 2:

h := x+3*y-77*z=55;

fsolve( {f,g,h} );

Use of the Maple engine

The Maple engine is used within several other products from Maplesoft:

MapleNet allows users to create JSP pages and Java Applets. MapleNet 12 and above also allow users to upload and work with Maple worksheets containing interactive components.

MapleSim, an engineering simulation tool.

Maple Quantum Chemistry Package from RDMChem computes and visualizes the electronic energies and properties of molecules.

Listed below are third-party commercial products that no longer use the Maple engine:

Versions of Mathcad released between 1994 and 2006 included a Maple-derived algebra engine (MKM, aka Mathsoft Kernel Maple), though subsequent versions use MuPAD.

Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB contained a portion of the Maple 10 engine, but now uses MuPAD (starting with MATLAB R2007b+ release).

Older versions of the mathematical editor Scientific Workplace included Maple as a computational engine, though current versions include MuPAD.
