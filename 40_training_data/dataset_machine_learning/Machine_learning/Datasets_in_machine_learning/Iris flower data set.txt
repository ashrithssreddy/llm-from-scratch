of the data set]]

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish each species. Fisher's paper was published in the Annals of Eugenics (today the Annals of Human Genetics). Only a small fraction of Iris-virginica is mixed with Iris-versicolor. All other samples of the different Iris species belong to the different nodes.]]

Originally used as an example data set on which Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was applied, it became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.

The use of this data set in cluster analysis however is not common, since the data set only contains two clusters with rather obvious separation. One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used. This makes the data set a good example to explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised techniques in data mining: Fisher's linear discriminant model can only be obtained when the object species are known: class labels and clusters are not necessarily the same.

Nevertheless, all three species of Iris are separable in the projection on the nonlinear and branching principal component. The data set is approximated by the closest tree with some penalty for the excessive number of nodes, bending and stretching. Then the so-called "metro map" is constructed.

R code illustrating usage

The example R code shown below reproduce the scatterplot displayed at the top of this article:

Show the data set

iris

Show the help page, with information about the data set

?iris

Create scatterplots of all pairwise combination of the 4 variables in the data set

pairs(iris[1:4], main="Iris Data (red=setosa,green=versicolor,blue=virginica)",

pch=21, bg=c("red","green3","blue")[unclass(iris$Species)])

Alternatively using ggplot and ggally.

install.packages(c("ggplot2","GGally")) # install packages if you don't have it.

Load libraries.

library(ggplot2)

library(GGally)

Plot scatter plot matrix for the iris data set

ggpairs(data = iris, # your iris data

columns = 1:4, # columns for the scatter plot

mapping = aes(colour = Species,fill = Species),

title = 'Scatter Plot Matrix for Iris Data Set',

) +

theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,face = 'bold')) +

scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Set1')

Python code illustrating usage

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

iris = load_iris()

print(iris)

This code gives:

{'data': array([[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2],

[4.9, 3., 1.4, 0.2],

[4.7, 3.2, 1.3, 0.2],

[4.6, 3.1, 1.5, 0.2],...

'target': array([0, 0, 0, ... 1, 1, 1, ... 2, 2, 2, ...

'target_names': array(['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype='
