VoTT (Visual Object Tagging Tool) was a free and open source Electron app for image annotation and labeling developed by Microsoft. The software is written in the TypeScript programming language and used for building end-to-end object detection models from image and videos assets for computer vision algorithms.

The VoTT source code is licensed under MIT License and available on GitHub. As of December 7, 2021, the project was no longer being maintained and its GitHub repository was made read-only.

Overview

VoTT is a React+Redux web application that requires Node.js and npm. It is available as a stand-alone web application and can be used in any modern web browser.
