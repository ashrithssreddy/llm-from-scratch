William Aaron Woods (born June 17, 1942), generally known as Bill Woods, is a researcher in natural language processing, continuous speech understanding, knowledge representation, and knowledge-based search technology. He is currently a Software Engineer at Google.

Education

Woods received a bachelor's degree from Ohio Wesleyan University (1964) and a Master's (1965) and Ph.D. (1968) in applied mathematics from Harvard University, where he then served as an assistant professor and later as a Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science.

Research

Woods built one of the first natural language question answering systems (LUNAR) to answer questions about the Apollo 11 Moon rocks for the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center while he was at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) is a widely cited critical review of early work in semantic networks.  This paper has been cited in the context of querying and natural language processing approaches that make use of Semantic Networks and general knowledge modeling. The paper attempts to clarify notions of meaning and semantics in computational systems. Woods further elaborated on the issues and how they relate to contemporary systems in "Meaning and Links" (2007).

Awards

Woods has received many honors:

1978, Fulbright Fellowship

1990, Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence

1992, Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science

2010, Association for Computational Linguistics Lifetime Achievement Award
