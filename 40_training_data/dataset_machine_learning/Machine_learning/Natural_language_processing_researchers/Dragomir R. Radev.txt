Dragomir R. Radev (August 7, 1968 – March 29, 2023) was an American computer scientist who was a professor at Yale University, working on natural language processing and information retrieval. He also served as a University of Michigan computer science professor and Columbia University computer science adjunct professor, as well as a Member of the Advisory Board of Lawyaw.

Radev worked in the fields of open domain question answering,  multi-document summarization, large language models and the application of NLP in Bioinformatics, Social Network Analysis and Political Science.

Radev received his PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University in 1999. He had served on the executive committee of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and as survey editor and associate editor of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

Radev died on March 29, 2023, at the age of 54.

IOL

Radev served as the coach and led the US national team in the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) to several gold medals Awards

As NACLO founder, Radev shared the Linguistic Society of America 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110519221302/http://lsadc.org/info/lsa-awards.cfm Linguistics, Language and the Public Award. He was the co-winner of the Gosnell Prize (2006).

In 2015, he was named a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery "for contributions to natural language processing and computational linguistics." He was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2020.

In 2022, Dragomir Radev received the 2022 ACL Distinguished Service Award.
