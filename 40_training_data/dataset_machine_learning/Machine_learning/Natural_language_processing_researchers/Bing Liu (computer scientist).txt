Bing Liu is a Chinese-American professor of computer science who specializes in data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. In 2002, he became a scholar at University of Illinois at Chicago.

He holds a PhD from the University of Edinburgh (1988). His PhD advisors were Austin Tate and Kenneth Williamson Currie, and his PhD thesis was titled Reinforcement Planning for Resource Allocation and Constraint Satisfaction.

Academic research

He developed a mathematical model that can reveal fake advertising. Also, he teaches the course "Data Mining" during the Fall and Spring semesters at UIC. The course usually involves a project and various quiz/examinations as grading criteria.

He is best known for his research on sentiment analysis (also called opinion mining), fake/deceptive opinion detection, and using association rules for prediction. He also made important contributions to learning from positive and unlabeled examples (or PU learning), Web data extraction, and interestingness in data mining.

Two of his research papers published in KDD-1998 and KDD-2004 received KDD Test-of-Time awards in 2014 and 2015. In 2013, he was elected chair of SIGKDD, ACM Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining.

Research on Association Rules For Prediction

Association rule-based classification takes into account the relationships between each item in a dataset and the class into which one is trying to classify that item. Liu and his collaborators described a new association rule-based classification algorithm that takes into account the relationship between items and the positive and negative classes. Opinion lexicons are word sets and opinion targets are topics on which there is an opinion.

In 2016, he was elected Fellow of AAAI "For significant contributions to data mining and development of widely used sentiment analysis, opinion spam detection, and Web mining algorithms."
