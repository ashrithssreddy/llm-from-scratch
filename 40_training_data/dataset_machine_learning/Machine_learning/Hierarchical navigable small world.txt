The Hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) algorithm is a graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search technique used in many vector databases. Nearest neighbor search without an index involves computing the distance from the query to each point in the database, which, for large datasets, is computationally prohibitive. For high-dimensional data, tree-based exact vector search techniques such as the k-d tree and R-tree do not perform well enough because of the curse of dimensionality. To remedy this, approximate k-nearest neighbor searches have been proposed, such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and product quantization (PQ) that trade performance for accuracy. HNSW-based libraries are among the best performers in the approximate nearest neighbors benchmark.

A related technique is IVFFlat.

Use in vector databases

HNSW is a key method for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional vector databases, for example in the context of embeddings from neural networks in large language models. Databases that use HNSW as search index include:

SingleStore

Apache Lucene Vector Search

Chroma

Qdrant

Redis

Vespa

Vearch Gamma

Weaviate

pgvector

MariaDB

MongoDB Atlas

ObjectBox

ClickHouse

Milvus

DuckDB

Kuzu

Cozo

TiDB

Several of these use either the hnswlib library provided by the original authors, or the FAISS library. libvictor is another high-performance library that implements HNSW and other indexing structures, designed for flexibility and integration in custom vector database solutions.
