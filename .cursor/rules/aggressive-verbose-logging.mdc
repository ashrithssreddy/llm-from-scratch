  For all training modules, aggressively log progress to a text file in logs/ folder.
  Each function or major step should have a clearly labeled header in the log file.
  Logs should be verbose but organized, with consistent formatting.
rules:
  - "Aggressively log progress to logs/ folder."
  - "Each function's log should have a header: '### FUNCTION: function_name ###'"
  - "Include timestamps and append to the same file, do not overwrite."
  - "Ensure logs are structured and easy to scan."
